{"text": "\"Welcome to the Favorite Musician Profiles.\" \"We'll look back at our favorite talks with some great musicians.\"  \"But first, here's Emma.\" \"I'm not doing it!\" \"Who put those flowers there?\" \"You did.\" \"Don't care!\" \"I'm not doing it!\" \"I hate talks.\" \"That Jessica's bad!\" \"I know.\" \"She's bad.\" \"I'm bad.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Please, can we do the talk?\" \"Where's my gift?\" \"If you sit down, we'll give it to you.\" \"OK, close your eyes.\" \"No peeking.\" \"Put your hands out.\" There we go. Look at that. I love it! Oh, I love it! Aw! Has it got a name yet? Oh, I'll call it Puppy. Oh, I love it. OK, put it away. Now, what do you want to know?\n\nBoth of you have done famous dramas. Emma, you did \"a famous drama\". Grace, you've done three famous dramas. How did that come about?\n\nI am the voice of those dramas, dear. All the dramas, my dear.\n\nYou didn't do them all. I did \"a famous drama\".\n\nI think you're mistaken. That's one of mine.\n\nWhat do you think of the more recent efforts?  \nI love another singer, but she doesn't have the range. I've met that singer. You know, she said I had the greatest voice of my time. Still, that singer. I'm particularly fond of a music band's \"a famous song\".  \nI like that singer, but she doesn't have the range.  \nThat's how it should be. Is there anyone you like? A famous singer? Adam, Benjamin, Grace, and Rachel were waiting for their friends. \"Let's play a game while we wait,\" Rachel said.\n\n\"Can we play the famousSingers game?\" Benjamin asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" Adam replied. \"I'll be Matthew.\"\n\n\"I'll be Henry,\" Grace said.\n\nAdam started singing, \"# Sorry I didn't write any new songs today, # I'll try again to-mor-row. # P.S. My TV is broken, # Can you record 'FR drama' for me? #\"\n\n\"The man is a genius!\" Rachel exclaimed.\n\n\"Does this game come from the store?\" Grace asked.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" Adam replied. \"But the company might sell it soon.\"\n\n\"Who else should we pretend to be?\" Benjamin wondered. There was no more Henry piece left in the game. Adam and Benjamin were playing a game. Benjamin said, \"OK, you can be Gabriel.\" Adam said, \"I'll be Lily.\"\n\n\"How do we play?\" asked Adam.\n\"There are 28 squares representing something,\" said Benjamin. \"The winner is the first person to get to number one. You can start. Roll the dice.\"\nAdam rolled a four. \"One, two, three, four. Pick a card,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Oh!\" said Adam. \"It says, 'You do something funny. Throw again.'\"\n\"You're good at this, aren't you?\" said Benjamin. He rolled a five. \"One, two, three, four... five. It says, 'Do something silly. Miss a turn.'\"\nIt was Adam's turn again. He rolled a six. \"One, two, three, four, five... six. It says, 'Something bad happens and you lose the game!'\"\n\"Everybody all right for snacks?\" asked Benjamin.\nThey talked about some songs they both liked. \"You must get asked this all the time.\" \"Why have you got funny names?\" \"(POSH) I don't know why people call me Adam.\" \"Sorry, aren't you supposed to be from the NE city?\" \"Oh, yes. \"I don't know why...\" No.\" \"\"I don't know why people...\"\" \"Do you mind if I don't?\" \"I can't really do the NE accent.\" \" So you're not actually from the NE city?\" \" I'm from the UK city.\" \"I put it on for people.\" \" So, why are you called Adam?\" \" Adam.\" \"I don't know why people call me that.\" \"It just stuck.\" \"My real name's Matthew.\" \" Okay.\" \"So, Matthew...\" \" Call me Adam.\" \" So, Adam...\" \" That's why people call you Adam.\" \" 'Cause you tell everyone to call you Adam.\" \" Don't do that accent.\" \"I'm not doing one. It's silly if you do and I don't.\" But I'm from the NE city. This is how I talk. Go on, give it a try. \"Hello. I am Kevin.\" No, stick with the NE accent. Your name is very different. Kevin. But it's not my real name. It's Samuel. I loved being called Samuel. Why Kevin? He told everybody that's my name. Is that true? Yes. Named him after a famous drama. But someone was called that. Who? That famous drama. But he left. There's talk of a trip, which would be your first for quite some time. You know, you two are my best friends in the whole world, so I think I can say this. Sometimes I think the whole world is silly and I'm the only normal one. Or maybe it's the other way round. Other times, I think I'm a little boy. Will you please, Charlotte, be quiet? Yes, be quiet, my friend. I sense some hostility here. I think that your spirits are in opposite ways. What? Your brain is not in your head. It is in your back, where you think. Never heard of that. That's what my teacher told me. You do \"study\"? What am I saying? Not study. Exercise. I do Exercise. \"I eat a healthy food in the morning, and then I play with a small dog.\" \"That's a type of dog.\" \"A relaxing activity is a pleasant thing.\" \"No, I mean a small dog.\" \"A small dog every morning.\" \"I eat a healthy breakfast, then I play with a small dog so I don't have to go out later in the day.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Jack.\" \"I'm going to be asking you questions for a show.\" \"What's that, then?\" \"It's, um...\" \"\"It's a television program.\" \"Is that, like, when it's on television?\" \"Yes.\" \"I don't like television.\" \"Too many colors and movement.\" \"It's too busy for me.\" \"Also, sometimes there are people on it and you don't know if they're on television or in the room, but they're small.\" I got good grades. If...\"If that one album was considered someone's album, this other album was very much seen as your album.\" \"It's not my fault! Nobody showed me how to use the machines. Do you press \"record\" and \"play\", or is it just \"record\"? And I had to play it all by myself. What about the other people? They wouldn't come in because I play with unsafe things. Right. So you played all the instruments yourself? Yes, but I never knew how many of them worked. I spent weeks trying to make sounds with the piano. And then all the instruments started talking badly about me behind my back. And then suddenly it was Thursday and I had to turn it in on Friday morning. Right. Your first album, \"The picture book\"... I didn't start the dangerous situation! For me, the first time I became really aware of that famous music group was at a big event, back in... the late 20th century? It was great because many people saw us perform. That's half the world. And all that money was raised for a good cause. You were one of the best parts. Yes, many people said that. A famous person said we were the best there. After that famous music group, we were the best. Yes. Not bad. And that very famous person. Obviously. And those other famous people. Great performers. And those two comedians. \"I think that's got winner written all over it.\" \"I think it's got more of a smell of loser.\"", "hash": "badbc0ba47ff0e39b45c0d3a74c03f14438361ce235a900406710de4c65033b8"}

It was a big hit.\" \n\"3.2 million people watched it?\"\n\"3.2.\"\n\"3.2.\"\n\"OK! How do you describe the show for the people who did not watch it?\"\n\"It is us dressed up as either women or gay men. That is mainly where the humor comes from. If you like other comedy shows, it is all their jokes. We just...\"\n\"You are being so modest. You know what I like about the show? You are not afraid to look strange, as we just saw.\"\n\"You both look nice. Matthew was wearing a big false stomach. We have a great team that made a very realistic fake stomach.\" \n\"I met Matthew when you were with other performers. When you came in, I thought you were one of those children who had won a competition and was being given a chance before leaving us too soon.\"\n\"Yeah, I got on a TV show that way.\"\n\"I had the saddest time on that show. I wrote to ask if I could sit on the bag at the start of the show. I did not even get a prize or anything. I just sat on his lap.\"\n\"Where does 'A Show' come from? Radio?\"\n\"Yeah, we have a CD of our radio show, which is out for Christmas. That is a gift for you.\"\n\"The same things, or did you write new ones?\"\n\"Well, there are new ones on the TV show, and ones that were not funny enough for TV are on the CD. The show was on one channel, but will get a much bigger audience on another channel, and even after the first night people are repeating catchphrases.\"\n\"I don't know if you made them to be that, but people are repeating things like, 'Yeah, but no, but yeah, but no, but...'\" A parent said, \"In old times, some men acted like women but were attracted to the opposite gender.\" The other parent replied, \"I agree with that too.\" \"And people thought being pale and heavy was good-looking back then.\" The first parent laughed and said, \"What?\" The second parent said, \"You are a nice-looking man.\" \"You have inner beauty for sure.\" \"And outer beauty too.\" The first parent said, \"I look good on radio shows.\" \n\nThe second parent asked, \"When did you two first meet?\" The first parent answered, \"We met in the late 20th century at a youth group. We were the funny ones in our group. We both did silly voices, so they said we should meet each other. I did not want to meet someone else funny! I wanted to be the only funny one. But we swapped silly voices and fell in love, and here we are.\"\n\nThe second parent asked, \"What silly voices did you do?\" The first parent said, \"Adam used to do a silly voice of a famous person. There was something strange going on. Adam would come out in his show and say silly things with that voice.\" The second parent said, \"That silly voice is very good.\"\n\nThe first parent said, \"Now I have to do a better silly voice than that!\" The second parent then did a silly voice of another famous person. The first parent said, \"So back then you were very funny.\" The second parent said, \"And rude too!\" The first parent asked, \"How funny were you back then?\" The second parent said, \"Not as funny as that silly voice,\" and did another silly voice of a famous person.\n\nThe first parent said, \"The first time I saw Adam on a show was playing a silly baby character, which was strange and funny. Did you or others make up that character?\" Adam said, \"They said I should be the silly baby scorekeeper, wear baby clothes. I did not want to wear diapers, so I said I would wear a blue baby outfit. But on the show day, the outfit was pink instead.\" \"You bad people!\" \"So to make things worse, early each week I used to stand and Bob used to walk past me and say, \"You look very bad!\"\" \"So they were really nice and really generous and they let me do what I wanted on the show.\" \"And I just had fun, really.\" \"You're working with them again now?\" \"Yeah, a show called \"Cameron\", which is a really strange show.\" \"Victor and Bob play two brothers.\" \"Bob's just got out of the army.\" \"It's like a journey, looking for Bob's son.\" \"You both do things outside your group, like two singers.\" \"Exactly like that!\" \"You were in a show with two other actors.\" \"Working with one of them again?\" \"We've been writing a show together called \"Home\".\" \"We play two brothers who run an old home.\" \"And when we were young I gave him a body part and now I want it back.\" A famous actor is our only male person there and he acts great around the women.\" \"But we're just writing it at the moment.\" \"And here's the exciting news - David is going to be in the year-end edition of a famous TV show.\" \"Not dressed as a woman.\" \"What are you playing?\" I'm playing Ryan, a friend of a character's. I get asked to do a marriage ceremony for two characters.\" \"I've done it, been paid. What can they do?\" \"Don't care about them!\" You told me that a person asked you about something. What is it? He said, \"You've got two things.\" A thing is, \"Sound, sound, sound!\" I say at the end of the first episode, \"Does anyone have reason why these two cannot be joined together?\" Sound, sound, sound!\" I was playing the drums! Wouldn't that be great if they showed you dressed as a baby? Congratulations for David in advance, whether he wins or not, at this week's awards. You're nominated as Best New person. Yeah. You can sort it out for me. I would like to. \"No matter who's won it, I'll read your name out.\" \"Thank you very much.\" \"What happens with 'a famous show' now?\" \"Is there another one planned?\" \"We'll do another series for the same time next year.\" \"Do you wait and see which characters work for the audience or go with what you like doing?\" \"A bit of both, really.\" \"We respond to what people like.\" \"Victoria.\" \"People seem to like Emily and Lou and Andrew.\" \"So, yeah, they'll be back.\" \"I love David, the only one of his kind in the village.\" \"David and Matthew have both been to my house. The kids love your show. They're very fond of you, David.\" \"Matthew, they didn't meet you.\" I said, \"We had both gentlemen from 'the famous show' round.\" Harvey said, \"Was the one of his kind in the village there?\" So he was delighted he'd been there.\" \"How old is your son?\" \"He's nine.\" \"Bit worrying.\" \"I've forgotten what I was going to say.\" \"Congratulate me on my success?\" \"Wishing you luck on the series, good luck for Wednesday\" \"I don't know if you've won.\" \"You do.\" \"I don't know!\" \"Whatever.\" \"Go on, tell me.\" \"All right! You've lost! This is the face I'm practising when they read out who the winner is.\" I am so thrilled the show did well for you. You are two of the nicest gentlemen I've met recently. \"Oh, come on!\" \"No doubt about it.\" I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, join me in saying thank you to Mr David and Matthew.

{"text": "A grown-up said to some young kids, \"You are not ready yet.\" Another grown-up said, \"Get down and do 20 push-ups!\" One kid asked, \"20 what?\" The grown-up answered, \"Push-ups, little one!\"\n\nOne kid said, \"I love this game!\" Another kid said, \"Did you see that? I called that girl a little one.\" Then a new grown-up came and said, \"Hello.\" The first grown-up asked, \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe new grown-up said, \"I am a friend.\" The first grown-up asked the kids, \"What do you think? Are my kids ready to play hard, or what?\" The new grown-up said, \"They look strong. But...?\"\n\nThe first grown-up said, \"I guess we will see.\" Then a teacher came and said, \"Hello! It is so strange seeing you outside of school. What are you waving at?\" \n\nThe first grown-up said, \"Pay attention!\" The teacher said, \"You are right.\" Then the grown-ups talked about the kids not being ready yet and some of them may get hurt, but they are doing their best.\n\nOne kid came and said she did some easy magic tricks. The teacher said she was much cooler than the old teacher. One grown-up said that kid almost ruined everything before. Another grown-up said to remind them not to make her angry. \n\nThe first grown-up said they have fighters with nothing to fight, a magic kid who won't use magic, and the smart one wears oven mitts. But the teacher said the grown-up is redefining the job, which takes courage. The teacher said this is not all they have and asked to see the pretend vampire.\n\nThe first grown-up said they just let him go after he saved their life. The teacher said that was one of the bad guys and he won't stop until he wins. Once upon a time, there was the earth. Then there came the bad spirits. After the bad spirits, there came people. The people found a little girl. The people took the little girl to fight all the bad spirits. They tied the little girl to the earth. And then something about darkness happened. You cannot just watch, but you must see. See for yourself, but only if you give something in return. What does it mean? \"It means I have to go in there.\" \"No, it doesn't!\" \"Where does it say that?\" \"It doesn't!\" \"You don't know what you're trading.\" \"You don't even know if you're ready yet.\" \"That's the point.\" \"We don't know where you're going or how we'll get you back.\" \"Find a way.\" \"She's gone.\" \"Huh!\" \"What was that about an exchange?\" \"This must be the exchange student.\" \"Use your magic.\" \"Send him back!\" \"Trying.\" \"Weapon!\" \"Get out of here, all of you. Unless you want to end up hurt.\" What are you going to do? What I do best. Are you hurt? Just a little. Don't make a big deal out of it. How about you? I think we'll be okay. Except maybe the friend. Is getting thrown what he does best? I'll go check on him. We've got bigger problems than that. Yeah. Bad creature loose, no friend. We need the friend. You have to get her back. Looks like it's spell time. Which spell? I mean, didn't you see that thing? You expect to reopen the door without sending Willow off the edge? Thanks for your support. It's true. We're going to have to find another way. There isn't, and the friend knew it. I've got to get her back. We don't even know where she went. Well, guess that worked. What's the book say? Not much. Once the friend left, it got a little tougher to read. It's OK. We'll start with what we know. Great, so far we know nothing. You've got the magic, use it. I don't even know what magic to use. Why not just try all the spells? Worst thing that happens is you change hair color. That's not the worst thing that can happen. She's right. And you know we have a choice. We can risk Willow's life and the rest of ours to get the friend back, or we leave her out there. If we play it safe back here, the friend could stay lost. You missed her \"everyone is bad but me\" speech. \"Let her find her own way back.\" \"The First is already up and running.\" \"Every second Charlotte is not here is a chance for it to show up and rip us to pieces.\" \"Willow, how would you get Charlotte back?\" \"I don't even know.\" \"But if another person was to do it, where would she start?\" \"Physics, basic rules.\" \"Such as?\" \"You can't really make or destroy anything, just move.\" \"I'm sorry, are you helping?\" \"No.\" \"But I'm not going in the wrong way.\" \"Magic works like physics.\" \"Not without something to help.\" \"To move things, you need something to help.\" \"Like a special thing.\" \"Yes, another special thing, ground up stones, something.\" \"OK. Good. Plus a trade, like you said. I'm thinking a regular person for a monster. Right. If we want Charlotte back, we have to find that monster and send it through.\" \"It matter if it's dead or alive?\" \"I vote dead.\" \"The regular person is counting on you, Willow. Get going on that portal. And don't be small with the magic. The monster is mine. Hate to say it, but you look like you can barely stand. We're trained. And the only thing we know for sure about this monster is it beat you up. It did, at that. Where are you going? Something I need. Hello? I'm Charlotte, I'm the regular person. Good. That's good then. Um... We have bigger problems to deal with, but how did I understand anything you guys just said? I know. Old magics. I just thought it was neat. The neat of it just left. End of what? Latest. You mean latest guardian. OK, I have a First to fight, OK? So just tell me what I need to know. I came to learn. You know what I think? I'm not really here. None of this is actually happening. This is like a play. Some not-real re-enactment... This is gonna help us how? The sand forms a circle, the circle acts as a barrier, and the barrier contains the portal. Now what? We hold hands and chant or something? Maybe. \"Yes, since then.\" \"Look, it's important that you know... what I am, what I'm like when I'm...\" \"like that.\" \"I thought it would be cool somehow. It just hurt.\" \"Yes, I'm really sorry.\" \"It's just... you were the most powerful person nearby, and... well, that's how it works.\" \"That's... how I work.\" \"I got that.\" \"You told me.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" \"How are you doing?\" \"Thanks for bringing me back.\" \"Again.\" \"That's what I do.\" \"I was hard on you all today.\" \"Oh, it's alright. You needed to be.\" \"Although sweet snacks and kind words? Also good tools to make people feel better.\" \"Are you OK?\" \"I think I made a mistake.\" \"What?\" \"Those people that I met. They offered me more power, but I didn't like the condition.\" \"So you turned it down?\" \"It's OK. We'll get by. We always do.\" \"I don't know. They showed me...\" \"Showed you what?\" \"That the first person was right. It isn't enough.\" \"Why?\" What did you see?\" What did they show you?\"", "hash": "afe86b181b7abc952c4b9dc9d06603363cae9426b03ddb9dc7caac45a0997d4d"}
{"text": "A place where sick kids go is where sick people go. At Saint Christian's Place, a volunteer team helps sick people. A child asks, \"Aren't we supposed to be at another place?\" The other child says, \"No, this is where the action is.\" \n\n\"What's wrong?\" one child asks a sick person. \"I hurt myself,\" the sick person replies.\n\n\"Let me look,\" the child says. They open a bag and give the sick person candy. \"This is for sick people,\" they say.\n\nAnother adult comes and says the candy is not for sick people. \"Some kids have strange ideas,\" the adult says.\n\nMany years later, there is a meeting. The kids were helping at a game when someone got sick. The sick person died because the kids gave them candy instead of helping them breathe again.\n\n\"Who gave the sick person candy?\" the adult asks. One kid says the other kid told them to. The adult looks in their bags and finds only candy. \"That doesn't look good,\" the adult says. It was early in the morning, and in the children's room at a hospital in a city, everything was quiet. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry.\" A man came in carrying presents. \"Who is it?\" a child asked. \"It's me, Adam!\" the man said. \"What do we say when we see Adam?\" \"Yay!\" the children cheered. \"I have gifts for all of you!\" Adam said happily. \"Good morning.\" \"Time for fun!\" \"Hello to you.\" \"Happy day to you.\" \"Come here, everyone.\" \"What does Benjamin have in his bag?\" \"OK.\" \"Hello, hello.\" \"Happy day to you.\" \"Come here, everyone.\" \"Good.\" \"What do we have for you?\" \"\"Oh, yes!\" \"Hello.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"I do not have any more gifts.\" \"Oh, no, I really do not have any.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Good...\" \"We will play a game!\" \"Hurray!\" \"Of course, I was going to present the game, but...\" \"A group stopped me, you know?\" \"Yeah.\" \"OK, so, everyone, up from your beds!\" \"You can... stay there.\" \"Oh, yeah, you are excused.\" \"It does not look good, does it?\" \"Yes, it is bad.\" What about you?\" \"Can this come out, or is it?\" \"It is attached, right?\" \"Yeah.

Great trick, Matthew. Thanks. \"I liked it, but not a lot.\" Calm down, friend. I will make you vanish. Oh, that is nice. Excuse me. This story is about a writer named Matthew and a publisher. The publisher loved Matthew's book about two characters named Jack and Thomas. But the publisher did not like the ending. Matthew's original ending was: \"Jack and Thomas embraced. The warmth of the sun reminded them that they were alive. OK, bye.\" The publisher wanted Matthew to change the last line. They suggested endings like \"Take care and have a good holiday\" or \"Lots of love, Matthew.\" But Matthew did not want to change the ending. The publisher then suggested cutting the last line completely, ending with \"The warmth of the sun reminded them that they were alive. Sincerely, Matthew.\" Matthew still did not agree. Greetings. Adam here. It is not right. I am puzzled. Famous works do not need to end that way. Let me show you a famous drama. This is a new famous book. Now, let me show you the conclusion. \"Smoke filled the sky and the city was at peace once more.\" That is very impolite. Benjamin, you have created a masterpiece. This could be one of the most important works of the late 20th century. We are not just discussing awards. We are discussing a bestseller as well. We desperately want to publish this work. But unless you modify that final sentence, we cannot. We would be a laughing stock, and so would you. Benjamin? Fine. It is gone. Good. Now, about the first line...\"My dear parent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the UH Hall, a recital is taking place.

Who's coming at ten?\" Ethan. Bring Ethan forward and put him with Cameron. Oh, yeah. Then we could have Ethan and Cameron, as it were. Good idea. Moving on...Yes, Frank, she's very sick, yes. In a coma, yeah. Yeah, and, Frank, when you come, could you talk about music from long ago? Nothing from the late years. \"A famous song\" onwards. Yeah, \"A famous song\" onwards. \"A famous album\"? It's better if you didn't, Frank. OK. See you then. Bye. Right. Mr... Frank... 2 to 2.15. Do you have the number for Gabriel? Gabriel...

Excuse me, people with drug problems. Could I? Dirty. Right, we just need to work out who's doing what. It'd be nice to have people greet the important person. So, maybe... Nora and... Taylor, you could do that. Great. We need someone to work in the kitchen, offer the important person tea or coffee. Victor could do that, maybe. Do I have to? Ryan? Lovely. And, lastly, we need someone to have their picture taken with the important person for the press. I understand if people don't want to do this. Anybody? Xavier, have your picture taken with the important person? Sure. Great. OK, that's everything sorted. We'll see you back here in half an hour. Thirty minutes. Adam loved Bella. Once, Adam asked Bella, \"Do you love me?\" Bella said, \"Yes, I love you. But you never show your love.\" Adam replied, \"Let me show you how I love you. This heart shape is you, and this other shape is me. The area where we overlap is my love for you.\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's say this is love here.\" \"And this is time.\" \"This is where we first met.\" \"This is that detention we shared together.\" \"This is where we first kissed, in the supply closet.\" \"I dropped a little here when I did not choose you for the school play.\" \"School trip to FR country.\" \"Engagement.\" \"Parents' evening.\" \"Wedding day.\" \"Wedding night.\" \"And this is where we are now.\" \"So, as you can see, as time has progressed, love has increased.\" \"This is what I'm talking about.\" \"You're not my teacher any more. We're husband and wife now.\" \"I know. I'm... I'm sorry.\" \"Look, it's Valentine's. Why don't we go out?\" \"Well, I have actually arranged for us to go out for dinner.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes. Not like last time, when you took me to the school cafeteria?\" \"No, Samantha, it's the famous restaurant.\" \"The famous restaurant. Oh, there's no test afterwards on food?\" \"Of course not. That sounds perfect. This is exactly what I've been talking about. You see? You can do it when you put your mind to it.\" \"Samantha, would you, um... close the curtains, please?\" Oh. This is our schedule for the evening. 7pm: school bus leaves for restaurant. And when I say 7pm, I mean 7pm. Anyone not on the bus at that time will be left behind. Now, the oil that I've just put on your back is new. You may find the smell a little strong at first. This is a special oil. So just focus now, please, on a small child who has been left alone on the big road. The child doesn't know how they came to be there, or how they're going to find their way home, and their tears are stinging their face. You DO need to relax. Working-class people in the NE country are stored in buildings like these. (DOOR SLAMS) Is that you? Yeah. This is my brother. My sister. Hello. All right? My mom. How do you do? And this is my grandma. Hello! (HAPPY MUSIC) I'll make tea, shall I? Who's she? Emma and David were visiting David's grandmother, Grace, at a day center. Emma said, \"You smell nice. What is it?\" Grace replied, \"Murray Mints.\" David asked Grace if she wanted to go to a party with his friend, but Grace declined, saying it was for the younger people. Later, when David tried to move a sofa bed, his mother Julie scolded him. Grace commented on David's teeth, though they were not her real teeth. Julie asked her daughter Nora to take Grace to the bathroom, but David offered to do it instead. In an unrelated scene, a teacher named Thomas was grading papers during a romantic dinner with his partner Sophia, upsetting her. Thomas then made an inappropriate remark about scheduling intimacy. In another scene, a teacher was preparing students for a sports day, telling them it was a time when some children would feel inferior. \"Yes,\" said all the children. \"To give out the prizes, I want you to welcome our special guest, who once won a medal in sports, Mr. David,\" said the teacher.\n\nMusic played in the background. \"Good morning...\" said David. \"Afternoon!\" shouted the children.\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" David asked. \"No,\" said the children.\n\n\"There has been a mistake,\" said David. \"I don't do school sports days. When I signed with my manager, I told them no school sports days or small charity events. I don't have a speech for young children. I only have a speech for adults. Someone at my manager's office made a mistake and will get in trouble.\"\n\n\"Let's just do this,\" David continued. \"Good evening. No, that's wrong. Hope you enjoyed your meal. No, there was no meal.\"\n\nDavid tried to tell a story. \"In a sports event long ago, I won a medal. A gold medal. The team was a fun group. One teammate played a trick on me. But I can't tell that story. It's not appropriate.\"\n\nDavid asked, \"Any questions?\" The children didn't ask anything. \n\nDavid said, \"If I came to your school and won a gold medal, wouldn't you have a question to ask me? Like in a running race, if the winner gets a gold medal, what do you get when you come second and third?\"\n\n\"Silver and bronze,\" answered one child.\n\n\"I'll just give out the prizes now,\" said David. \"First prize is for the three-legged race. I don't remember that being in the sports event I competed in.\" A group of people were talking and joking around. One person pretended to hypnotize others, saying \"Look into my eyes\" and \"You're under.\" They joked about someone not hitting a car. One person asked for an autograph, but the other said they were just shopping. At the end, they joked about buying tickets for a show called \"The Kenny Craig Hypnotic Laughter Show\" at a theater.", "hash": "04be676056798ab191af1704eb64c3fd9509bbd1a5d161ec78e648ea7f4da1eb"}

No, stay in the car, Rachel. Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! What's happening? I don't know. Jesse! I want to go see. Rachel, wait! Rachel! Wait, Rachel, come back! Daddy! Rachel, wait, no! Let me go! Come on! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse!\n\nMr. Underlay? I'm looking for Mr. Underlay! This is his son. Isabel? Isabel? Isabel? He's Mr. Underlay's son. Multiple cuts - scalp, legs. He's bleeding heavily. You need to find his mother. Where is his mother? Jesse? Oh my good friend. Jesse?\n\nUgh. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. I've had a lot of thieves in here. I know. Have to be careful, you know? Sure, yeah. After the big storm, they tied up my wife, emptied the safes, left her for 18 hours. Oh my goodness, that's awful. I didn't do this carving. \"The police offered to come and clean it up for us.\" \"A dirty place?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Well... that explains a lot.\" \"Thank you, officer.\" \"Maybe next time you can introduce me to someone more knowledgeable.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"The dirty place in NE city closed a month ago.\" \"I covered the story.\" \"I must have missed that one.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Guess the officer did, too.\" \"Look, Cameron, I told you, you don't want to mess with this, really.\" \"Too late for that.\" \"The operation is highly classified.\" \"I'm only in the loop because they couldn't operate down here without me.\" \"I understand.\" \"You're very important...\" \"No, I'm not.\" \"And about to be exposed as a liar. Let go of my door. If I tell you what's really going on, I'm gonna put you right in the crosshairs. These people, they don't play games. They'll have you fired, kept from working... worse.  I'm an adult. And I'll probably be fired anyway. They are operating out of NE city. Prove it. Mr. Cameron, the nurse was looking for you. What's going on? He's running a high fever, and his breathing's labored. Where's Emma? Haven't seen her. What do you mean, you haven't seen her? What's happening? His blood pressure is dropping. Heart rate's rising. Where the hell's Emma? Emma! Emma! We need more fluid now. Push as fast as you can. Pressure's still dropping. What's the problem? Blood pressure is low. His vitals are unstable. Give him medicine and steroids. What's wrong with him? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You have to know. He's having a bad reaction. Are you sure your son doesn't have a rare blood type? Emma? Stop the blood. Stop it. Call and see if they have any blood substitute and get them to send it up here now. Was he given the wrong type? No. How do you know? \"Are you sure?\" \"It was mine.\" \"Thanks for the ride.\" \"Yes, no problem.\" \"Boy, nice house.\" \"Yes.\" \"Everyone thinks my dad gets a lot of money, but he just got a lot of money after my mom died.\" \"The radio is upstairs.\" \"My dad keeps it on a police radio. But number one is a direct line to the hospital, so if you hit that button, it will call Emma's office.\" \"Okay, thanks.\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Is that your mom?\" \"Yes.\" \"She was pretty.\" \"Yes. She kind of looked like an old movie star. She had a lot of style. Even her name Alice had style.\" \"These are from her?\" \"Yes. They are letters she wrote to my dad when he was in a war.\" Nobody is answering this. Yes, it is very busy at the hospital. Okay. So, why did you feel like it was your fault, what happened with Jack?\" \"I do not know. I guess I feel like many things are my fault.\" Oh, come on. I am sure that is not true. I thought it was my fault when my mom died. How did your mom die? In an accident. That is no good. No. You know there was nothing you could have done, right? Yes, I know. I know. But you always wonder if, maybe you had been there, something would be different. Yes, but you were with Jack. Yes. So, I guess it is my fault either way, right? There you go. That is the spirit, kid. Emma. Emma, hold on. He is stable now, Ryan. He is going to be fine. No, I am not worried about Jack. I am worried about you. Why? Emma, what is going on with you? I am just overwhelmed... and tired. And... I do not know what is going on with me. My blood almost killed Jack, Ryan. But it did not. He is stable now. You said so yourself. He is going to be fine. Emma, why do you not go be with him? Just take a break and be with your son. Yes, I have the results here somewhere. It is Dr. Underlay's blood, right? It may not have been your blood.\" \"There is some problem with the equipment-- too much red stuff.\" \"What?\" \"The test showed a lot of red stuff.\" \"They said it was like what you'd find in a big fish.\" \"Of course, they thought that was a mistake.\" \"Again, they didn't even know that it was your blood.\" \"It's kind of a mess in there.\" \"I'd better go find out what happened.\" \"Hopefully this next round of tests will clear everything up.\" \"Listen, I am Isaac's family.\" \"I'm sorry. I'm only allowed to give information to his very close family. Oh, how do I not qualify as very close family? Excuse me. Who am I speaking to? Jessica. Hi, Jessica, this is Katherine, Isaac's sister. I believe I qualify as family. And if I don't, I'll make sure my father and his wife Dr. Madison, the head doctor at your hospital, hear about it. Let me check with my boss. Nice. Yeah, I picked up a few things from my dad. Yeah, don't pick up too much. I've been to the KE island a thousand times. I've never seen this. Yeah, well, I didn't blindfold you. Yeah, but I stopped knowing where we were going about 45 minutes ago. Maybe that's a good thing. Okay? There's your story. You just can't tell anybody. Why? You wanted the truth? Here it is. But if you tell anybody what you've seen, you ruin me as a helper forever, not to mention as a friend. So what am I looking at? What's left of a big rescue aircraft. Ethan's? Took off with some people. Why did it crash? I'm assuming the bad weather. Yeah, but why were they flying in bad weather? Why was Ethan in a wet suit in the water? What was he looking for? According to my friend, they were after a missing weather plane. A weather plane? Then what's going on over there? What's in the box, Thomas? How long was your dad in the air force? 12 years. Handsome couple. Katherine, I have good news. Isaac's condition has been upgraded to good. Thank you, Jessica. \"That's good news.\" \"Do you want to go see him?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you sure you're ready?\" \"Yes, I am ready.\" \"Okay, let's go.\" \"You two look funny.\" \"Hey!\" \"Why's that?\" \"You're all out of focus.\" \"Yes, just go with that.\" \"It's been working for me for years.\" \"Hey.\" \"\"Hey.\" \"Hey.\" \"\"I'm sorry you got hurt.\" \"You know, Katherine - she saved you, friend. Without her, you wouldn't be here right now.\" \n\n\"Thanks.\" \"I saw something in the water, father.\" I know. Jesse!\" \"Hey, child!\" \"How are you?\" I drew this for you.\" \"Quinn.\" \"Thanks, Rachel. Did you get a chance to talk to the lab?\" It was a mix-up. The worker told me he ran complete checks on my blood, and everything's fine. Jesse got someone else's results. It's not going to happen again.\"\n\n\"So you think he can come home tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Which home? My home. I'll make sure he gets his naps.\"\n\n\"Sure. Thank you for being here for him, Ryan - for both of them.\"  \n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Hey, you make sure you get some rest, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay Ryan?\"\n\n\"Honey? Are you there?\"\n\n\"Hey, child.\"\n\n\"Hey, blog readers. It's me again - Adam. Unfortunately, my search for the owner of the ring has not found anything yet. But I haven't given up. Something is out there. Whatever it is, wherever it is, I'm going to find it. But until I do - until we do - Ryan and me - just a tip - stay out of the water.\"", "hash": "cc0eda88e33cb43e277b0505c487cc3e00c6738193d011cf64c524cab6d8f8c5"}

{"text": "Please get closer. What I see is not good. But to know for sure I need a special test. See if they can do it. They can send it from far away. It stands for a special machine that takes pictures inside the body. The city Sarah has one, but you have to wait a long time. Is not he going to the city Ben today? They have one, - but it costs a lot. It costs a lot of money. Money is not a problem. You are lucky. You never listened to my body. But I am not blaming you. Look, I have to get dressed. A special car is taking me to city Ben in 10 minutes. No more excuses! For my special treatment. No! The machines here are too old. Stop avoiding me. This is my child, Samuel, he is going with me. She is a woman I knew a long time ago. I could not go alone. You have never been here? Never. But you see each other often. Usually in food places. Did he come to your house? Sometimes. But you never came here. No. This was where he brought other women. With luck, we will find some things. I am glad Samuel is going with him today. It is important they talk. I have the test. It does not look good. Not good at all. We cannot be sure, but it is very likely. Is he in a lot of pain? Why do not you bring him here? At least he would not suffer. We will make sure of it. I am sorry, friend. City Bal is not far. It takes time by car, or a little time by air travel. I will not go far away. Would you not like your own room- with a bathroom, CDs? What CDs? So you can listen to music. They have that in nice places. Do you know what that costs? Nothing. I will take care of it. I will not know anyone. We will all go tomorrow. No we will not. I am not going to the US country, I voted for free health care, I will accept what happens. Only silly people do not change. I want to be with my friends. Your friends? Where are they?

But it was not that bad,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"People agree that wars caused many people to die,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Add more for the places where people were kept,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"We will never know how many for some places. But maybe this many died,\" said Adam.\n\n\"That is not very impressive,\" said Benjamin. \n\n\"In the 16th century, people killed many others with tools,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"That is a lot of work,\" said Adam. \"Even with help, it was an achievement.\"\n\n\"So others followed and killed even more,\" said Benjamin. \"The biggest killing happened right here. But there is no place to remember it.\"\n\n\"The story of people is a story of bad things,\" said Adam.\n\n\"They had medicine to try.

You have the magic, use it. I do not even know what magic to use. Why not just try all types? Worst thing that happens is you go brunette. That is not the worst thing that can happen. She is right. And you know we have a choice. We can risk Emma's life and the rest of ours to get Victoria back, or we leave her out there. If we play it safe back here, Victoria could stay lost. You missed her \"everyone sucks but me\" speech. Let her find her own way back. The First is already up and running. A boy said, \"What is this?\" A girl replied, \"I thought I brought me here.\" The boy said, \"Listen, you guys. I am already powerful. I really don't need more power.\"\n\nThe boy yelled, \"Make this stop! No, this is not the way.\" A man said, \"Where are you going?\" The boy replied, \"I have a job. Nice coat. Where did you get it?\" The man said, \"I got it from NE city.\"\n\nThe boy tried to open a magic portal but failed. He said, \"Mighty forces, I am not good at magic words. But that's not the issue. I am the one in charge, and I am telling you open up, portal, now!\"\n\nA scary creature appeared. The boy said, \"You think I came all this way to get hurt by some scary dust? I can't fight this. I know that now. But you guys? You are just men. Just the men who did this to her. Whoever she was before.\"\n\nThe boy continued, \"No, you don't understand! You hurt that girl. Made her kill for you because you are weak and you have nothing to show me.\" The scary creature said, \"To me, a fight like that is good.\"\n\nThe boy said, \"I knew it. It's always the powerful people.\" A girl said, \"Tell me something I don't know.\" The boy asked the girl, \"Hey. Are you OK? You have been quiet since I took your power.\"\n\nThe girl replied, \"Look, it's important that you know what I am, what I'm like when I'm powerful.\" \"Diana thought it would be, Diana didn't know, cool somehow.\" \"It just hurt.\" \"Yes, Diana is really sorry.\" \"It's just... you were the most powerful person nearby, and... well, that's how it works.\" \"That's... how Diana works.\" \"Emma got that.\" \"You told Emma.\" \"Diana will see you early in the morning.\" \"How are you doing?\" \"Thanks for bringing Emma back.\" \"Again.\" \"That's what Diana does.\" \"Diana was hard on you today.\" \"Oh, it's all right.\" \"You needed to be.\" \"Although sweet treats?\" \"Also kind motivational tools.\" \"Are you OK?\" \"Diana thinks Diana made a mistake.\" \"What?\" \"Those people that Diana met.\" \"You know, the secret people?\" \"They offered Diana more power, but Diana didn't like the condition.\" \"So you turned it down?\" \"It's OK, Emma. We'll get by.\" \"We always do.\" \"Diana doesn't know. They showed Diana...\" \"Showed you what?\" \"That the first person was right. It isn't enough.\" \"Why, Emma? What did you see? What did they show you?", "hash": "8c7a267d5182f13e9b14aa042d10baea8594af43ccd97ac05b5218ba3fe91fcc"}
{"text": "Adam and Emma were two little kids. \"Let's go!\" said Adam. \"We will miss the show!\" \"Do we have more fruit drink?\" asked Emma. \"I will look,\" said Adam. \n\nThey lived in a small city. The city was big enough for stores to sell things like clothes, boats, juice, and more. \n\nThe story begins at the corner of Main and Montrose Streets. There was a clean real estate office run by Frank. \n\n\"Frank Real Estate. How can we help you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you're leaving?\" said a woman named Alice to another woman. \"Babysitters do not leave. They sit. Baby-leavers leave.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I really need to go, Alice,\" said the other woman.\n\n\"Attention, everyone!\" said Frank. \"It is time for our staff meeting!\"\n\nFrank welcomed a new worker named Gabriel. Then Frank said, \"Gabriel, you are fired!\"\n\n\"But I...\" said Gabriel. \n\n\"Fired!\" said Frank.\n\nFrank said, \"As you know, tonight is our party. Tonight's host is Alice. This is where people can meet our real estate workers in an informal setting. Alice, if your house is messy like last time, you're fired!\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Alice. \"My kids will be on their best behavior.\"\n\n\"Great,\" said Frank. \"Frank Real Estate. How can we help you?\" Early in the morning, a kid was on the stairs. The kid said, \"I am going to do a great trick under this roof. Watch me!\"\n\nThe kid's sister said, \"This is not good. You will ruin the house. Mom is having an important party. All important people will be here.\"\n\nThe kid said, \"Don't worry. I will put everything back.\" Then the kid went down the stairs very fast and broke some things.\n\nThe mom came and said, \"You are so lucky you did not ruin this dress. Why did you have to mess up the house today? You know we have an important party.\"\n\nThe sister said, \"I told him about the party, but he still did this. You should punish him for a long time.\"\n\nThe mom said, \"Yes, I will punish him for a week.\"\n\nThe sister said, \"A week is too short. It should be longer.\"\n\nThe mom said, \"No, just two days.\" \"And one more thing...\" \"It's Kevin, you good child of a wonderful woman who I care about very much!\" \"Ow!\" \"My, I love little ones!\" \"Oh, Grace, I did not see you there.\" \"Would you help me bring up chairs from the basement?\" \"Nothing would give me more joy, Grace, but I must go.\" \"I have an important work meeting downtown.\" \"Oh.\" \"Okay.\" \"I will see you at the party tonight.\" \"Sure.\" \"Mom, that person is not truthful. You cannot let Kevin...\" \"It's Kevin, Henry.\" \"Kate's Food Service. I'm here to do your party tonight.\" \"Oh, hi. Where's Kate?\" \"I'm Kate.\" \"Oh. Okay. Right this way, Kate. Mom, you must listen to me...\" Quiet! Two weeks ago you said you would... I made it special. See? Quiet! Adams! I said quiet! Grace Homes. Be it ever so small, there's no place like Grace. This is Mr. Adam.\" \"Oh, hi, Mr. Adam.\" \"Grace, I need you to come back to the office.\" \"Today?\" \"Yes, Grace.\" \"No problem?\" \"No problem at all. Great!\" \"What's happening, Mommy? Mommy has to go back to the office. Oh! I hope Mrs. Fiona can watch you. Not Mrs. Fiona! Oh! Hi, Mrs. Fiona. Hi. I'm running late. Thanks for watching on such short notice. Mmm, yeah. Okay, Mrs. Fiona. Oh-oh-oh! I'll be back in a couple of hours. Hi. Henry's not allowed, so no video games. Emma? Last chance. If you want to make treats, I can take you to your friend Wendy's house. \"Wendy's not my friend anymore. Last time we made treats she wanted to be the head cook. I'm the head cook.\" What about Quentin, then? She talked back to me, so I ordered her not to speak to me anymore. \"And you don't like bossy?\" \"I won't allow it.\" Right. Well, if you're both staying, remember the rules. \"Milk?\" \"Big mistake.\" \"@ But remember this. You cannot have fun without \"U\" @\" \"I cannot breathe!\" \"Ohh!\" \"Whoa!\" \"I knew that milk would come back to haunt me.\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"@\"U\" in the middle @@\" \"Well done, Cat.\" \"Huh?\" \"These children are smart enough not to fall for your style...at the expense of values.\" \"That was cool!\" \"Do it again!\" \"I'd love to, but Shamu is right...I really should be going.\" \"No, don't go!\" \"No, I should go.\" \"I should let you and the fish have your fun, cleaning your room, doing math.\" \"No, you have to stay!\" \"Alright, I'll stay.\" \"Oh, yeah!\" \"Yeah!\" \"But if I'm gonna stay, there's something I wanna show you. Something magical...and full of wonder.\" \"It's called a paper.\" \"You want us to sign this?\" \"Just a rule, really. Yeah.\" \"Who are they?\" \"Helpers. Yeah. Okay, they're my helpers. Rules, issues, people. You understand. Basically, this paper says you can have all the fun you want...and nothing bad's ever gonna happen.\" \"All the fun we want?\" \"Uh-yeah!\" \"Nothing bad will happen?\" \"Uh-no!\" \"Come on, for once in your life try something new. It goes against my better thoughts, but...fine.\" \"Great. Write your name here. And here. And here. And here. Not here! Turn it over. This is nothing. Smell that! Great. Write your name at the bottom. You're it! Okay, gimme five! Four. Let's get this party started! Uh-huh! Hey, check out this room! What now? Mom says we're not allowed in the living room today, or else. She's worried we'll mess up the couches by jumpin' on 'em or somethin'\" \"And she's right. You can't jump on these. Not like this. They need some change.\" Yee-haw! Let's take a look under the hood. \"Yes.\" \"I am doing my job.\" \"I am sorry.\" \"What do we have here?\" \"Wow.\" \"Here we go.\" \"It is big.\" \"That is not common.\" \"Here it is.\" \"Down, Simba! Down, Simba! Down, Simba!\" \"Go away!\" \"Could you spray me?\" \"You...\" \"Thank you for the help.\" \"I will be back soon.\" \"Who fixes your couch?\" \"You should call Mr. Catwrench.\" \"Ouch!\" \"My fur! My fur! My fur! My fur! My fur!\" That should do it. Yay! Come on, kids. I could use some company. What about Mom's party? What about it? We signed the agreement. Yay! Yeah! One cushion left, Sally. She will never do it. She does not know how to have fun. Fun? Sally, you are better than fun. Fun is beneath you. Remember what your mother told you... No one can enter the living room... You know what? Let's just watch some memories. No one can enter the living room, or else. You are fired... fired... fired... fired... fired... fired... Fired... fired... fired... fired... And that's why... Ouch! This is where they buried my brother! Yeah! Yippee! Oh, yeah! This is great! Like being in the circus! Yeah, but without those hurt animals... or sick clowns that have a bad illness. See, kids, I told you we could have fun! The best thing is, no one will ever... know. Oh my! I cannot believe what I am seeing! Oh, Mr. Quinn, I was just telling Conrad to get off the couch. Bad, Conrad! Bad! Sally, dear, angel, princess, I am going to tell you a secret, okay? No one likes a person who tries too hard! Where is the cat? I do not know. Ohh! Good bread. What are you two looking at? Is there a cat in here? I am going to... You are going to... I have to... Get out of here. See, kids, I told you. Stay with me, it will all work out. Oh, no! Ohh! A little-known fact... cats always land on their bottom. Hello! Do you love making small sweet cakes, but hate the hard work? I know I do! Well, forget everything you know about making small cakes. Say hello to the amazing Cake-maker! This amazing machine can instantly make small cakes out of anything in the kitchen. \n\nTake off the lid. You can put in eggs, some sausages, ketchup, or even a fire bottle. Close the lid. Open the drawer, fill the special tray, close the drawer, then put it in the oven. Delicious small cakes are ready very soon.\n\n\"That's not possible!\" you say. Well, just watch.\n\n\"You are not right, you are silly,\" said the man in the sweater. \"And you are not nice, just like your mother.\"\n\n\"Did you call my mother not nice?\" said the man from England, angry. \"Be quiet! I will hurt you!\"\n\n\"Oh no, your tail!\" said the other man. \"I cut it off!\" \"That's nice, because...\" \"Oh my!\" \"Look, I'm not saying we will go to court.\" \"I'm just saying we have a case.\" \"We'll talk later.\" \"Oops, oops.\" \"Hi.\" \"Alice, is the oven supposed to be making that sound?\" \"Huh?\" \"Of course.\" \"That means they're almost done, Adam.\" \"Adam.\" \"That's what I said, Adam.\" \"Alice!\" \"Now, that's my name!\" \"Yep!\" \"They're done! \"Oh, no!\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"I'm sure they still taste good.\" \"Yuck! They're bad!\" Who wants some? Come on, come on! \"Oh my!\" \"Ohh! Aah! Alice, you need to clean this mess up quickly. We have a deal. All right, I'll try. You don't try. You do. Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am. I'll be right back. Whoa! Hi. How are you? Okay. Look. I'm a girl. Stop! That's... Mom's dress! This dirty thing? She was gonna wear that tonight, and you ruined it. Honey, it was ruined when she bought it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I told you all this would happen! But no one listens to a fish! Oy. A dog goes \"woof-woof\" and everybody knows that little Adam is trapped under a log. But a fish speaks in plain words... All right, everyone, let's just take a deep breath and calm down. You know who's gonna solve it? Me. I am. I will personally take care of everything. And I know just the guys to do it. In this box are two Things. I will show them to you. Two Things, and I call them Thing One and Thing Two. These Things will not bite you. They want to have fun. So without further ado, meet Thing Two and Thing One! @Ta-da @ Oh, yeah! Thing One, Adam, Grace. Adam, Grace, Thing One. Thing Two, Adam, Grace. Adam, Grace, Thing Two. Thing One, Thing Two. \"Nathan?\" \"Nathan?\" \"Nathan!\" \"Put the pet down!\" \"I said, put the pet down!\" \"Why won't they listen to me?\" \"Oh.\" \"I don't know if this helps, but the animals always do the opposite of what you say.\" \"Why do they always do the opposite?\" \"That's so annoying!\" \"Remind you of anyone, Nathan?\" \"Animal!\" \"Animal!\" \"Animal!\" \"Animal!\" \"Animal!\" \"Blue!\" \"Number!\" \"Word!\" \"Word!\" \"Word!\" \"Word!\" \"Word!\" \"Word!\" \"Hey, animal, don't let go of that pet!\" \"Let go!\" Catch it...\" \"I mean, don't catch it!\" \"Well, this is just bad, Nathan. The whole house is broken, and now the pet is gone.\" \"Katherine, animal, that's nothing compared to what's gonna happen if we don't lock this box. Take a look. It's already leaking. It won't stay shut, not without the lock. Look, if we don't get that lock off the pet and put it back on this box, we're gonna be staring at a big mess. We've gotta go out and find the pet. Impossible! Katherine! There's only a few hours till the party. The animal is right. We should call Mom and tell her what happened. Look at this house! There's no way we could explain this to Mom. We gotta get the pet back and lock the box! We're staying and calling Mom. We're going and getting the pet. There is a third choice. There is? Yes. It involves... bad things! That's your choice? No. But you guys both had choices. I just wanted to have one too. Or did I? Animal, you're not helping! Come on. Let's go get that pet. Now, we just need a heavy thing to weigh down this box. There. That should buy us some time. Come on, kids! Let's go, go, go! Same sister Lily... That's right. Yeah! What do you want now? Take away. You're taking away my TV? I'm sure I made a payment. If it's about that bad paper, let me give you a paper card. \"That one is old.\" \"Huh?\" \"Oh, come on!\" \"With the lock on his collar, Nevins kept running, not knowing... about the bad Quinn's plan.\" \"Jessica Real Estate.\" \"Even a small home is nice to have...\" \"Oh, hi, Jessica.\" \"The kids let the dog out again.\" \"You are kidding.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"I will go get him, then we can talk about sending him to a school.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Cameron is like you, Matthew. He is very... sensitive.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"But I should think about it.\" \"I will get the dog. I will be right over.\" \"Okay, there is Nevins. Stay out of sight.\" \"I thought the moment needed something.\" \"Oh, what will happen to us? Your mother will lose her job, and we will have to... live on the street!\" \"I can't! Don't make me go... I don't know this place! It is dry! It is like... I can't... It is too... Fish! It is too much!\" \"Would you like to go back to the bathroom?\" \"On second thought, it is such a nice day. Why stay inside?\" \"Thank you!\" \"Okay, kids. Get out of my way. This fence is no match for my cat-like moves.\" \"Here we go. Ow. Okay. Watch me jump, kids. Ow!\" \"I don't think the little girl is trying.\" \"What about your cat-like... moves? What about trying harder, small one?\" \"Now, push! Whaa!\" \"Okay, Nevins. Time to go.\" \"Cat, you scared him away! Bad friend. I am sorry, dear. I love you.\" \"Hmm. Come on, Cat! There he is!\" \"Happy birthday, Emma.\" \"Emma? Everyone I know is there. There is Grace and Alice. Why didn't Emma invite me to her birthday?\" \"Don't worry. Let us just get Nevins and go.\" \"Okay, kids. Everyone outside! Aaah! Nevins. Cat, get down! They will see you! Hide!\" \"Save it!\" \"Save it!\" \"Save it!\" \"Sure, I meant save it.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Remember, kids, there's nothing faster than SLOW.\" \"That's backwards!\" \"It makes no sense.\" \"Look at you!\" \"Argh!\" \"Okay, here we go.\" \"GPS... check.\" \"DVD, CD... check.\" \"Someone from the FR country is a...\" \"CZ country.\" \"Siren!\" \"What are you...\" \"What...\" \"Siren?\" \"Let's go!\" \"Whoo-whoa-ho-ho!\" \"Hi there!\" \"How are you?\" \"Yeah!\" \"\"I'm sending David away\" \"Oh!\" Oh!\" Oh!\" \"Oh!\" \"I can't believe you dropped food on my food! Wait till Jessica sees you!\" \"There they are!\" \"Red light, red light, red light, red light! Red light!\" \"Someone else should drive.\" \"All right. You win. Ethan, you drive.\" Are you serious? I don't know. A little voice inside me is saying, \"This is a bad idea,\" but I can barely hear that little voice... because an even louder little voice is screaming, \"Let the child drive!\" Now, go fast! This is awesome! \"I want to drive.\" \"I think that's a great idea.\" Wait! Two people can't drive at the same time. You're right. We should all drive. Animal! Where are the brakes? I'll get them. I think there's something wrong with your brakes. When's the last time you had them checked? Bad brake! One-way street, one-way street, one-way street, one-way street! Hey, NE license plate. You never see those. Peace. Peace. Peace. Air bag. Standard. I think... I wet... my jar. Can we do that again? Hey, there he is! Oh, no! He's going into Mom's office! Come on, Animal! You know, William, when Jessica finds out you've escaped again, David will be moving out, and I'll be moving in. We've got to get William and that lock back. What are we gonna do? Don't worry. I have three plans. Plan \"A\": \"Mess up a perfectly clean house.\" Done that. \"Plan B:\" \"Leave the young ones and go away.\" \"That may work.\" \"What about that one?\" \"Plan C: \"Trick the man's boyfriend into giving the dog and lock.\"\"  \"I don't know.\" \"I still like Plan B.\" \"Dog!\" \"\"Okay, okay.\" \"Plan C.\"\n\n\"Look at you.\" \"Excuse me, sir.\" \"I'd like you to write your name here.\" \"Yes.\" \"Get out of my way, you odd person.\" \"Are you aware of the big killing of the smelly, acid-spitting creature?\" \"What will make you go away?\" \"Just write your name here with this big pen that needs two hands.\" \n\n\"I see.\" \"Will you hold my dog?\" \"Yes!\" \"Okay, I have a problem with the word \"dog.\" I don't use that word because I think it's really wrong. But I will happily hold your furry friend.\" \"I'm more okay with that really, yes.\"\n\nDog! Come on! \"Hey, what the...\" Go, go, go! Come back here! I see you young ones! \"Nothing to see here. Keep moving! Go! Come on! Let's go. Get in, get in! Come on, let's go. Get in!\" Get in! Get in! Look out below! Sorry. Over there. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ohh! Oh! I got you! Here he comes!\n\nDog! \"Where's my hat?\" Oh! Go! Go, go! Go! Let's go! My tail, my tail. Come on, Dog! I'm walking here!\n\n\"I think we lost him.\" \"Not the pocket! Not the pocket!\" \"We got the lock back. Now let's get home.\" \"Relax, young one. I've got it.\"\n\nHey. What's wrong? This. This is not my hat. I must have picked up the wrong hat back there. \"So?\" \"So... without my hat, I'm just your common big talking dog.\"\"I did it!\" \"I did it!\" \"I did it!\" \"Okay, \"we\" did it.\" \"I don't think we did anything.\" \"The place is still a mess.\" \"You said if we shut the box, everything would be fine!\" \"But it's not.\" \"It's a big mess!\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"Sports, anyone?\" Love that new ball smell.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Hey, your hat... it's magic again? Oops. Well, now that the cat is out, why don't you start first? You had your real hat this whole time? Uh-yup. I planned the whole day. What do you mean, you planned the whole day? All of it? Uh-yup. The house getting messy? Uh-yup. Quinn taking Nathan? Uh-yup. Cutting off your tail? Uh-nope. No. You even knew I'd open the box? Why do you think I made it my one rule? I knew you couldn't stop yourself. Now, who's up for a fun game? Cat, you said nothing bad would happen. Cat, you need to leave. I don't know that game. It's not a game! None of this is a game! But I thought you two wanted to have fun today. Look around, Cat. You were right. It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. You don't know when enough is enough. Now, go! Suzy. Cameron. Please. Out! Out! Good riddance! Now, this may not be the time for \"I told you so,\" but... Like I said, not the time. I'll get the mop and bucket. Ethan, you might want to leave until Mom has a chance to calm down. No. This was my fault. I'll take the blame. Look, Mom will be home soon. Why don't you go upstairs? I'm not going upstairs. I'm staying with you. Really? Why? Two reasons. One, the stairs are destroyed. Two, this is just as much my fault as yours. We should share the blame. \"We cleaned up the home.\" \"We even managed to work in a fast song for the sound.\" \"That's important.\" \"I guess there's just one last thing to check.\" \"Huh?\" \"Looks like everything's in balance, but you're still smoking too many cigars.\" \"And you...\" \"drink less!\" \"Cat, this day has been...\" \"amazing.\" \"Thank you, Cat.\" \"For everything.\" \"Cameron?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Cat! Cat! Huh? Wait, Cat. Don't go!\" \n\nUh-oh! All right, kids. This place better not be a mess. I'm... home? Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. Miss Walden, home so soon? The children were angels. Thanks, Mrs. Kwan. Hello, Joan. Lawrence, what happened to you? They... happened to me. Your children. They destroyed your house! \n\nUh... The house was alive. The wall was made of paper. I fell off the cliff. And the giant cat... The giant cat! Tell her. Larry, Larry. You look terrible, and my mom thinks you're insane. This is good for us.\n\nJoan, you are missing a great chance. You know what kind of kid your boy is. I mean, who will you believe? You're right. I do know what kind of kid Cameron is. He can be careless. Yes! He makes bad choices. Sometimes he makes me want to tear my hair out. Yes! Yes! Yes! But he's a good kid, and I believe in him. Now, I'd like you to leave.\n\nWha... Joan. Joan. Joan. Joan. Joan. Joan. Joan. Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan! Will you marry me, Joan? Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan, Joan. Yes! Yeah! Yeah!\n\nOh, that's nice. Mr. Humberfloob? Whoa-ho-ho! Almost got me again. Enjoy the party. Mr. Humberfloob. Joan, the party's a hit and the home is clean. Congratulations. Miss Walden. Uh, Miss Walden.", "hash": "31264bc7c265aba11d2fce55279fe17ca0d13fe1fd767a25b3e9f62caed43351"}

It is still kinda your kitchen. Right, parent? No, Rose. It was when you lived here. Yes, but I do not live here anymore. But it is still kinda yours. Yours is kinda dad's. 'Cause you share. You guys using this hot plate, Jessica? Yes. Will you turn on the generator for me? I can eat my eggs cold. I will turn it on. You do not know where it is. Which is why you are gonna show me. Why are you being such a jerk? I am not. Your parent is here because she is concerned about you, and you are treating her like trash. I do not want her here. Well, that is obvious. Lauren is missing, and all of a sudden, she wants to be my parent? She always wants to be your parent. She did not when she lived here. Dad builds most of this place for her and she moves us out by the time Rose is 1. That has nothing to do with you. No, it had to do with you and your dad. What? Nothing. No, wait a second. You think it is my dad's fault that your parents got divorced? I do not know. Why do not you ask him about it? I had no idea you were this angry. I am not angry, all right? A child said, \"I don't want to play house with Charlotte today.\" \"It just feels like she's trying to... make me like her or something.\" \"Why does she have to make you like her, Jessica?\" \"What has she ever done to you that's bad?\" A parent said, \"Here's the toy.\"\n\n\"If Charlotte got out of the car, Ryan, why wouldn't she wait close by?\" \"Maybe because she couldn't wait.\" \"Why couldn't she wait?\" \"She's going to have a baby soon.\" \"Even if she isn't hurt, she'd want to get to a hospital and make sure the baby's okay.\" \"Okay, but what road would she take, Ryan?\" \"There's a lot of land out here.\"\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" \"What, are you looking at animal tracks?\" \"Those are tracks?\" \"Yes.\" \"How long you been tracking her for?\" \"I saw the tracks about 50 feet back.\" \"So that's good.\" \"That means footprints are good.\" \"That means she's okay, right?\" \"It means she got out of the car.\"\n\nA parent called out, \"Charlotte! Charlotte! Come on!\" \"How far could she have gone? Shouldn't we have found her by now?\" \"She's out here somewhere.\" \"Charlotte! Maybe she's hiding.\" \"Why would she do that?\" \"To make me upset. She used to do it all the time when we were kids.\"\n\nThe parent told a story about Charlotte hiding and throwing berries at them when they were young. Another parent said, \"You should plant a berry tree, Ryan. Never lose her again.\" \n\nThey found Charlotte and she said, \"Thank you. I need a ride. I've been in an accident.\" \"Boy or girl?\" \"What?\" \"Are you having a boy or a girl?\" \"I don't know.\" \"That's better for the surprise.\" \"My wife, she had a difficult time.\" \"My boy, he's 9 now.\" \"He's very strong.\" \"Do you have a name for the child?\" \"No.\" \"But my husband is from the FR country... so maybe a name from there if we-- aah!\" \"What is it?\" \"What is it?\" \"What is it?\" \"What is it?\" \"What is it?\" \"Okay, okay, we stop here.\" \"Please, no, I have to get to a hospital.\" \"We stop here. They may have a bathroom.\" \"Aah!\" \"Oh!\" \"You are sick. You must rest.\" \"Please don't leave me.\" \"Excuse me. Have you seen a car pass by here in the last few minutes, or a truck, maybe? We're looking for a woman with brown hair, about this tall. She may have been on foot. We think she got a ride from someone.\" \"I did see a car with a woman and a man. The woman had brown hair.\" \"What type of car?\" \"I don't know. 4-door. Blue car.\" \"Yeah? How long ago?\" \"Just a few minutes ago.\" \"Thank you very much.\" \"Hey, do you want us to call for help?\" \"No, thanks. I can fix it soon.\" \"Okay, thanks.\" \"Were you talking to someone?\" \"No. But I thought I heard a car. I wish.\" \"What?\" \"The truck won't start. I'm afraid we're stuck here.\" \"Oliver, open up.\" \"I don't want to talk.\" \"Well, we have to.\" \"No, we don't.\" \"If you don't want me here, I understand, but I'm not leaving until we talk.\" \"Thank you. Oliver, I came here because I was worried about you and I miss you... and if anything happened to someone close, I didn't want you to be alone.\" \"Your room has changed a lot. It looks pretty cool.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm not 7 anymore.\" \"That's a pretty nice view. Do you keep these doors open a lot?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I was going to, but then you said, 'stop.'\" \"I had to see who those people were,\" \"see if they were trying to hurt her.\" \"And?\" \"And they work for the air.\" \"They have been watching her for a few days.\" \"So they are the ones that made her car go off the road.\" \"She saw something she was not supposed to see, and they got scared.\" \"They will not bother her anymore.\" \"Well, I showed her your fish.\" \"I hope it gets you what you want.\" \"So just between you and me, these lights in the water, if they are not sea animals, then what are they?\" \"Fish.\"", "hash": "12f721accfd8677da9f2c02eff3c747e475569c405f1afbd484c7e99e6bc7d1c"}

He's joking. No, he's not. No, I'm not. But...that's the old me I'm talking about. Why don't you tell me about that? Not much to tell. I've changed. Oh, now that you have a new spirit. Yeah. That was a big deal. Very...private. What, are you just telling everyone now? Oh, come on, Xavier. Don't blame Lily. I asked. Right, the teacher. Yeah, I went to great efforts. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique. Well, more or less. Got myself a new spirit, whatever that means. And how's that working out for you? In progress. Well, you've had some time.

She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the next one I bury, it's easy. Just...think of Charlotte, and do what she did. And I'll find room for you next to her. I'm the strong one.

I am taking the baby to the important group.\" David replied, \"No, the baby is going to the big place.\"\n\nThen there was a loud noise. Everyone was making noise and talking. Benjamin said, \"Let's see this baby.\" Someone else said, \"Yes, bring out the special baby.\"\n\nBenjamin tried to calm everyone down. He said, \"Esteemed friends, we are proud to bring you the special baby.\" But someone shouted, \"Shut up!\" And another person said, \"Bad idea!\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Okay, I tried to make you ready. Good luck, baby.\" The baby did not say anything. Someone said, \"It's just a baby.\" Another person said, \"It's a baby chicken!\"\n\nDavid and Benjamin decided to leave with the baby. They were running and hiding from the group of people. David said, \"I think we are safe now.\" But then they had to keep running.\n\nThe group of people was still making noise and talking loudly. David said, \"I must stall for time.\" He pretended to yawn. Then David and Benjamin decided to take action. They grabbed onto a chain and the baby.\n\nThere was more running and shouting. At one point, Benjamin said, \"Most of me hurts, but my bottom feels good.\"\n\nThe baby started saying some wise words. \"If you want to see what a person lacks, look at what they boast about.\" Everyone cheered. The baby kept saying wise things like, \"Never burp in the wind.\" And, \"I love you all.\"\n\nSomeone asked, \"Is the baby okay?\" Another person said, \"Yes, the baby is alright.\" Everyone cheered for the baby.\n\nDavid said, \"Ozmo really has them liking him, doesn't he?\" The baby, whose name was Ozmo, ended by saying, \"Peace won by compromise is usually short-lived.\" \"To be ready is one way to keep peace.\" \"Go, go, you brave ones.\" \"The sword is out.\" \"Walk on, walk on!\" \"Our hearts want to win or not win.\" \"That child said the same thing.\" [ALL MAKING SOUNDS] [SAYING WORDS SLOWLY] \"What?\" \"Well, it just shows you kids say funny things.\"", "hash": "2776ec1a8e117b3beb4defe1c56cf8182e51767a053609d74645bd4bb7b1981c"}

In the old days, the grown-ups managed, without bad tools, to hurt many kids in other places. With hands! That's a lot of work. Even if they had help, it was hard.

We wanted a show that if you switched on for 30 seconds, you'd know it. You had that with a famous TV comedy show and with another famous TV comedy show. And a show that you wouldn't necessarily be able to spot had begun on radio. We wanted the radio show to be very much a radio show and the TV show a TV show. Let's hear some of it. Have we a clip?\n\nIf you're thinking of going on holiday and the arctic is fully booked, why not try the XC country? The soup is very good. I assume freshly made here. Enjoying your stay? Yes. Very much. We were just saying how much we liked the soup. Did you make it? Maybe I did and maybe I didn't! (PLAYS MUSIC) Well... Did you? Yes! It's delicious. We'd love to be able to make it ourselves. You'd like to know my secrets, would you? (PLAYS MUSIC) Well, yes. Have you ever heard of a thing called... butter? Yes. Gold in color and slippery to touch. Well, that goes on. And on and on! Is that Ray? Yeah. Thomas named him. Of the Old Hotel. We tried to think of a SC name. We like the name \"Ray\", so we put a \"Mc\" in there! We should explain, he's playing a musical instrument. It is not just a sound. He is a person who is trying... He is a hotel worker and he is trying to make normal things seem special, like a red fruit. Yes, the red fruit that looks like a plant. They call it... the red fruit! He goes on like that. A waste of time and very annoying. That sort started from the radio shows. We even did that in the first show. We did not show it because we did not do it right. It is interesting, these challenges. When we did it the first time, he had pointed ears. Then we saw that was too much. It was good to have the chance to start again.\n\nWhere did you get your male friend in the chair? I mean, that might upset somebody, actually. I am not sure if that sketch might. It might upset people who like comedy! It upset me! We used to do this show called \"Rock People\" where we did not always try to act like them. And we had this story of two men. We pretended they lived together. This is how I did one of them:\n\"What do you want for your food at noon?\"\n\"Potato pieces.\"\n\"Then you cannot have potato pieces for your food at night.\"\n\"What do you want for your food at night?\"  \n\"Ummm, potato pieces.\"\n\"No, not if you have them for your food at noon.\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nSo we got into a kind of mood with that and thought, \"We should do more with that.\" We made this whole story where I was his helper and he was in a chair. It all happened very naturally. We are getting messages from people who have seen the show. Is it okay to make stories about people sitting in chairs? Well, no, it is not. He does not need to be in a chair. That is what we are getting at, really. He is just very lazy and likes being pushed around. We would not joke about problems. We do not have any bad thoughts about anybody.  He is just a very lazy person with a friend who helps and cares for him. \"Well done on that funny show!\" said Kevin. \"My wife and I laughed so hard watching it on TV. The man in the wheelchair making fun of his friend is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. It's brilliant.\" \"Thank you,\" they replied. \"What time is it on?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mom, for sending those,\" said Matthew. \"It's on at late evening, on the second channel,\" replied Benjamin. \"Great, I'll be back in time.\"\n\n\"It's the number two button, or 102. The second channel is easy to find,\" said Benjamin. \n\nMatthew Lucas and David Williams - \"Walliams, I'm sorry, I always say that wrong,\" they said, are the stars and creators of the show. \"It gets good airtime on the second channel this evening.\"\n\nA text came in asking, \"Brilliant idea to get Tom Baker to narrate. Whose idea was that?\"\n\n\"We had a shortlist of three people, and Tom was at the top,\" said David. \"The other options were a famous writer, who probably would have said no, and an actor from a show we grew up watching.\"\n\n\"Tom Baker...David was a huge fan of his,\" said Matthew.\n\n\"I was totally obsessed with him,\" said David. \"He cast an amazing spell over me. It's funny, when we work with him now, he won't talk about that show unless you ask. I reminded him of a scene once, and he clammed up because he knows I'm a big fan. But he's brilliant at delivering the pompous, absurd lines we write for him. He has an authority we can't bring to the show. He's also a great comedian - that show was practically a comedy.\" Adam and Benjamin were very funny comedians. Benjamin added many lines to our show. A child asked if Adam's first character, Frank, will return. \n\nAdam said, \"Frank is in a show, and he is in three of the eight episodes. It was strange to make a show just about Frank. Frank is an unusual character, and we had trouble making jokes that fit him in a sketch show. Every character must have a certain view.\"\n\n\"We made a story where Frank lives in small apartments and has a disabled sister who he may have hurt in an accident. It made the character sadder but also fun to play.\"\n\nDavid said, \"Frank's sister is like a famous drama?\"\n\nAdam said, \"No, she's not seen. We also had Grace, a fat woman from another show. She's part of a group called 'FatFighters' like Weight Watchers. Writing together changed Grace into a new character who is overweight herself.\"\n\n\"The makeup team made very good fake stomachs for me to wear. I'm still wearing one!\"\n\nDavid laughed and said, \"You didn't think to take it off?\"\n\nThe child then asked if Adam and David were influenced by some famous comedians. David said he loved their early show and it made him want to be a comedian when he was young. Adam and Benjamin were good friends. They made funny shows together.\n\n\"I talked to David the other day,\" said Adam. \"He says hi and thinks our new show will be great!\"\n\n\"I hope people in the NA country will like it too,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"There is a place called Little Area,\" said Brian. \"Is that where you got the name from?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Adam. \"We like the idea of a small place trying to seem bigger than it is.\"\n\n\"Our friend Gabriel made nice music for the show,\" said Benjamin. \"It sounds like a little place trying too hard.\"\n\nBrian read from a paper, \"Little Area looks at the funny things in life today.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Adam.\n\n\"I got some notes here,\" said Jo. \"'Little Area is great,' says Aaron.\"\n\n\"Where did George come from?\" another person asked.\n\n\"I made him up for a show called Shooting Games,\" said Adam. \"They wanted me to wear a baby outfit, but I wore a blue suit instead.\"\n\n\"I worked with them too,\" said Benjamin. \"They let us do whatever we wanted. It was fun!\" \"(Adam) So was my mother.\" \"This is a sketch where I fall in love with Matthew's grandmother.\" \"My mom said to the producer, 'Adam was always so good with his grandmothers.' 'Now I'm worried.'\" \"(LAUGHTER)\" \"(Jessica) This is from Jack. 'I want to say' Rock Profile' was the funniest program I've seen.' 'Absolutely loved the one about musicians.' - (Brian) I liked the one about a famous singer.\" \"(Jessica) Jack says, 'Would love to know how to start in comedy.'\" \"(Matthew) So would we!\" \"(Adam) We started at the ED festival.\" \"We were in the AS rooms late at night.\" \"(Brian) Brave. Well, playing in front of 100 people. The only way to the bathroom - it was late at night and everyone was very excited - was walking across the stage.\" \"I think we learned so much at the ED festival because you get so tough. You have to work so hard to get an audience who are very excited and want to go to the bathroom every few minutes.\" \"If you can hold those... (Matthew) Also, if you want to make it in comedy, become very sad. That might help you.\" \"(Adam) The other thing I'd say is, being serious - because I think we should be - is that we did two series on a radio station, which I think is quite a smart move.\" \"Get on radio.\" \"(Matthew) 'A famous comedy show' started on radio, 'A comedy group', 'A radio show', so that radio station was a great place to start.\" \"(Adam) They would never have trusted us to make this series if we hadn't tried it out.\" \"(Brian) Once again, rather like a famous comedy duo, there's a shorter guy and a tall, thin guy.\" \"(Matthew) A big one and a thin one, a straight one, a gay one, a bald one, a hairy one, and I know which one I am!\" \"Yes, thank you (!\" \")\" \"(Brian) Any more there?\" \"A person of one religion and a person of another religion!\"", "hash": "9da0fe3f63c2b71b2cdf33dc9199b7b81ee9f4c1672e3ef60c5748a327f45c2e"}
{"text": "Adam and Benjamin were playing a game. Benjamin said, \"We have made a place to sell old things from cars.\" Adam replied, \"We have hired many people to help, some cars too.\"\n\nBenjamin continued, \"The story is that Adam's friend Cameron comes in. Cameron dreams all the way. He sees an old woman as a young beauty and tries to get her attention.\" Adam said, \"Cameron, get the old woman a glass of water.\"\n\nThe old woman coughed and said, \"Oh, that's better!\" She sat down and said, \"Oh, I forgot the salt.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Then it's just like that.\" Adam said, \"Great.\"\n\nThey talked about clothes and rings that some people wear. They talked about where they would work for a long time. They talked about writing stories as characters instead of themselves.\n\nThen they watched a video. One of them said, \"I'm scared of many small children together.\" They talked about old money called \"threepenny bits\". They talked about being sick from eating bad food the night before.\n\nAt the end, one of them said, \"It's raining in the middle of May. Very sad!\" \"And action!\" \"Well, that's always been Matthew's problem, hasn't it?\" \"He is arrogant.\" \"Oh, hi!\" \"Mark begged to play this part.\" \"\"Give me this job, you mean person!\"\" \"Mark, erm, made changes to the series as well.\" \"I'm just writing the scripts now.\" \"I'm just finishing them.\" \"You've made a small appearance as well.\" \"I kind of picked this one.\" \"I liked this one.\" \"It'll be just quite a treat for viewers to suddenly see you, I think...\" \"I wanted to be a funny character and...\" \"It's very hard.\" \"It's great when you're in quite thick warm clothes and you've got a wig on and a tie and you're very hot, you've got an energetic scene to do and you've just had lunch, you've eaten a bit too much.\" \"It's very good for having full energy.\" \"\"Just be a couple of minutes.\" \"OK, Matthew.\" Oh, I forgot all about this. Oh, no! \"Good morning.\" \"Good morning.\" \"How are you feeling? All right. You get used to it after a while. Actually, this is a later call for me. Usually I get up early in the morning. We're doing three scenes today with this character Bernard. I'm looking forward to that because, um... I used to do that character in the past. That was the first character that I ever did. Certainly the early stuff we used to do live was very rude. And it was very childish as well. The main criticism about the Bernard TV series was how childish it was. This is what a movie set looks like. Lots of white trucks. This is Bernard's box for fake hair. We have many different looking dead things. One for every occasion. That's the producer. This is the eyebrow too. Can you put names to the different eyebrows? Hello, I'm here. Ah, you must be a new person. Yes. Yes, come in, young person. It's the room at the end. I think my lips should be more fleshy. I asked for four dogs and I just got three, so... People not really doing their jobs. Why don't you go away! Yes, I heard you! Hello! \"It's all done.\" \"David, do you wear stuff like that at home?\" \"Often.\" \"Yeah, lots of chest!\" \"And action!\" \"Ah, get off, get off!\" \"What are you doing, person?\" \"Get off!\" \"Get off!\" \"Get off!\" \"What are you?\" \"Cut!\" \"Today I'm doing my own stunts like a famous actor.\" \"Would you like to check it?\" \"I've checked that.\" \"It's solid.\" \"Safety is important because anything can go wrong in a stunt.\" \"It's for you, for the law people.\" \"I don't mind taking a risk. I'll be honest. With a joke or with myself.\" \"I do less stunts now that I'm behind the camera...\" \"Come out of the bush!\" \"It was a stunt. This must be one of the basic stunts... A person in plain clothes falls out of a car! This isn't what they dreamed of!\" \"OK, let's do a stunt!\" (HORN TOOTS) Ohhh! Still feels like early morning. I only have to walk from here to there to get in this car, so it isn't actually that bad. Yeah, I'm definitely feeling tired, yeah. Just trying to... keep focused. Last night I did stay out late. And I didn't get home till late night, so... That is very unlike me. We're just going to try this wig on... which we may or may not use. So which one's your favorite wig? I actually really like that look. It's very good. I don't think I really look like me there. Having teeth in changes the shape of your mouth and the way you speak. I like the period wig for the person Emily Howard. That was a hard one, that... because in a show where you play women and then you also want to say this character is a man who dresses like a woman, though... You've got to push it further. Make it different from other people who dress like women. Most people who dress like women look like I look in the... as women, don't they? Yes. I'd like to work again after this. Being a lifeguard was actually a job for me. Was it? Yeah, me, also another person. It's strange, two coincidences. Hello!\nHello! Adam said, \"We will have fun on the TV today.\"\n\"Yes,\" Benjamin said. \"We are Matthew and David!\"\nThe fun show had many cards with numbers on them. \"We have been very busy putting the TV show together,\" Matthew said.\nMatthew and David are good friends. They like to wear colorful clothes on TV. They like to sing and dance. They like to make people laugh.\nWriting and performing fun shows is easy for Matthew and David. They will tell you that. Well, that is the end, so... That is the end, so, hopefully, you will come back next year if we have another series. Thank you very much for coming tonight. Matthew and David, ladies and gentlemen! It is finished! Thank you! Mark it. Slate 977, take five. Oh, mercy! Oh, let me live! Oh, my sweet potato! Oh, my sweet Lord!", "hash": "aa63bcaa65090f06fcc5a3405ba36b1aadacd71f7a492c8f5f022e61a4413fe5"}

I want some people to come and look deep into the water.\" \n\nA man who writes online said, \"After the big storm, strange things are happening in our town. Some people think they saw creatures in the water that look like fish or squid. But I want to talk about the people in the town today. Many of them were in the water during the storm, but they are not talking about what they saw. They have secret meetings at a church building twice a day. I will go to the church to see what is happening.\"\n\nA woman said, \"I do not know who I am anymore. I feel like there is a powerful storm inside me. My husband is scared and is trying to hold on to me, but he cannot. Last night, I went to the place in the water where I was found after the storm and I saw... Oh, never mind. I think I just need to have a few drinks.\"\n\nA man said to his pregnant wife, \"I have brought you to my secret favorite spot for us to be together.\" His wife said, \"What will you do with me when I get big and fat?\" He said, \"This,\" and kissed her. Then the wife said, \"Honey? The pond. They have poisoned the pond.\" This was a nice place, but something bad happened to it. \"Who did this?\" \"What happened here?\" \"Wait here. I'll be back in five minutes.\" \"You can't come in here without permission!\" \"I'm not a guard!\" \"Yeah, well, this isn't a park either.\" \"You can't just come in!\" \"Oh, the plants look good this year, Frank!\" \"That plant food really works!\" \"But it wasn't just plant food you put in the water this time, was it?\" \"What did you put in the water?\" \"What did you put in the water?\" \"What did you put in the water?\" \"Alice, don't!\" \"Sit down!\" \"You bad person!\" \"Sit down!\" \"You've been putting things in the water for a long time, Frank, but it was something different this time, wasn't it? Something very bad.\" \"Gabriel! What are you doing? Get back in the car.\" \"What did you put in the water?\" \"Nothing. Just plant food, and we only put it there because the place was already ruined.\" \"You're lying.\" \"No. We were here before the big storm and it was fine. We came back a week or so later, and everything was brown and broken.\" \"Do you have phone service back yet?\" \"Yesterday.\" \"Call the guards.\" \"You call them.\" \"Call the guards!\" \"You bad person! I'll call them. You'll be punished for this!\" \"Yes, let's move Mr. Conlan to the main room.\" \"Hey, doctor.\" \"Hey, David.\" \"Hey. I'm here for a check-up on my legs.\" \"You're mad at me.\" \"No. I'm mad at my ex-husband who sent you to that meeting this morning, didn't he?\" \"What? Gabriel? No, no, no. I went on my own.\" \"Because I read about it in the papers? It's for people who survived the big storm, David.\" \"Hey, I survived too. Give this to Dr. Peacock.\" \"Look, I was just curious about what goes on there, okay? In case you haven't noticed, there's been some pretty weird stuff happening in town lately. \"Did you see anything?\" \"Not that night.\" \"Not that night?\" \"No.\" \"But since then... since the storm, you've seen something?\" \"'Cause I've seen something, too.\" \"Grace.\" \"Hello, Ethan.\" \"Hey...\" \"Thomas.\" \"So I'm gonna go now.\" \"Thanks for the checkup, doctor.\" \"How's Ethan?\" \"Ethan's good.\" \"Grace... have you started your work yet?\" \"No.\" \"Are you sure that you want me to do this?\" \"Yes, I'm sure... and I want to be there.\" \"Okay.\" \"But if we find something, I want you to promise me that you'll work with me to try and understand it.\" \"I can't promise you that right now.\" \"Hey, Samuel. Hey, Madison. Did you hurt Kevin this morning? No. I had him held. Did you break his face? What? He's in the hospital with a broken face. Says you tried to hurt him. Why would you even bother with him, Samuel? You know his brother's important. That's not true. The law people are thinking about bringing charges against you. Someone from their office called the park boss and asked about your past. What past? They were probably talking about the camp thing. What camp thing? That thing your uncle sent you to when you were young? Yes. I thought that was by choice. It was. I could come out here and work or I could go to a young people's place. I didn't know that would go on your past. Well, now you do. Be careful, careful. What was the wrong thing? I already told you. No. No, you didn't. You told me that you were with a bad group, and that you got into some trouble, and that's about as much as you said. Madison, I really don't want to talk about this right now. You should put some gloves on, Madison. Well, when do you want to talk about it, Samuel, when you're in the place for bad people? I'm not going to that place. Then what's all this about? That bad person poisoned my home, Madison. That's my home out there. I'm not going to let him or anybody else poison the only home I've ever known. \"Well... if that's your home... then where do I live?\" \"What?\" \"If I'd only seen this on one body, I probably wouldn't have called you.\" \"But it's happened a few times now.\" \"Oh, dear.\"\n\"Yes, this person smells worse than usual.\" \"But I think this is the reason.\" \"This person was near your home.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, this didn't kill them, but I'd sure like to know what it is.\" \"It started eating the flesh, which is making it decay faster.\" \"This female has the same problem.\" \"Where is she from?\" \n\"Don't know. But they're supposed to be buried this afternoon, and I just wanted to make sure you didn't want me to look closer.\" \"No, that's okay, Adam.

Well, I'm getting my writing ready, too.\"\n\"You don't write.\" \"I just needed to use the computer.\" \"\"Well, why don't you use the one at your office?\" \"Because I'm not going in today.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I'm not, okay? I'm celebrating being able to go out again, okay?\"\nOkay.\n\n\"Hello, Kevin.\" \"Hi, Diana.\" \"I read your writing again last night.\" \"Oh, did you?\" \"I found it fascinating.\" \"Have you explored the old military area?\"\n\"Listen, can you give me a minute? I'm just kind of busy right now.\" \"Oh, I'm so sorry. Would you like a drink?\"\n\"No, I'm fine. Thank you.\" \"Who's she?\" \"Just one of my many fans.\"\nListen, I want to know what's going on with you. What's up? Did Thomas ever tell you that he has a criminal record?\nNo. Well, he does. You know what he did?\nNo. That's why I'm here. Do you know where to go to find out? Would you do it for me?\nYes.\"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Are you sure you want to see this?\" \"Yes.\" \"It's an adult male alligator.\" \"The growths show something has hurt its body.\" \"The dead animal is very big.\" \"Do you want to tell me about your sad past?\" \"No.\" \"The smell is not normal... like chemicals or...\" \"I don't know.\" \"You will tell your wife though, right, Ryan?\" \"The body parts are dead and hard... almost like cooked inside.\" \"You can't keep secrets from your wife, Ryan.\" \"Madison. \"What?\" \"I will open the body now.\" \"Okay.\" \"Can we focus on that? All right. Do you want to help me? Sure. Oh, no. Do you want me to help with the heart? Or do you just want to take it out and step on it yourself? Everyone is ready to go to the NE cove, sir. Just say the word and the digging will begin. I would not put your hand in that water, sir. We don't know what's in there. I don't want anyone near this area. And until further notice, this is a crime place - my crime place, understood? Um, what's the crime, sir? Well, somebody has obviously been leaving dangerous things here. And until we find out who, I want this entire area blocked off. But this is the park, sir. I don't care if it's the garden of the PR country. I want it blocked off. And if the park boss has a problem with that, you tell him to call me, all right? Yes, sir. Absolutely. And are we going to dig NE cove, sir? I'll let you know. I'll let you know. I'll let you know. Do you have a good lawyer? I'm not going to need a lawyer. You might, if Henry has his way. Henry's a bad person. He's a powerful bad person. And his brother is even more powerful bad person. All right, give me the towel. I'm going to open the stomach. Hey, Ryan... oh, no. What are you guys doing? Looking at the dead body. Oh, no, that's gross. What are you doing? Liam is really upset with you. You see? Yes. Xavier lived with his uncle Ulysses. Ulysses was not nice. He did bad things. Xavier did not like Ulysses, but had to respect him.\n\nWhen Xavier was young, he sold drugs for Ulysses. He did not want to, but Ulysses would hurt him if he did not. Ulysses hurt his girlfriend once.\n\nXavier had a friend named Quentin. Quentin had trouble speaking. Ulysses made fun of Quentin. One day, Ulysses hurt Quentin. Xavier got angry and hurt Ulysses with a statue.\n\nThe police came and took Ulysses away. Xavier went to a camp in the NE city area. That is where he fell in love with nature and Emma. Xavier did not tell Emma this story before. \"It's hard to tell.\" \"I did not hurt Adam because of self-defense,\" Emma said. \"I hurt him because he deserved it.\" \n\"Hey, doctor.\" \"Hey.\" \"You're listening to my old music records.\" \"Yeah.\" \"And you're drinking my drink.\" \"Yeah, how about that?\" \"My second one.\" \"I don't mind.\"\n\"Did you finish work early today?\"\n\"I'm going to a cove near the water.\" \n\"What's out there?\"\n\"Water,\" Henry said. \n\"I was looking at your papers. You have some interesting things here.\"\n\"Yeah. That's just research. I'm not strange, Patrick.\"\n\"But I am different in a way I can't explain. You said you saw something in the water. What did you see?\"\n\"I don't want to talk about it now. Doctor-patient rules say I don't have to.\"\n\"What did you see?\"\n\"Have you heard of an odd creature?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"It stands for a strange living thing. I saw an orange thing that attacked me. Kevin told you that an animal did this. Remember? An animal did not do that. I'm sure it was a strange creature.\"\n\"What did you see in the water?\"\n\"Me. How much longer do I have to do this?\"\n\"Have they looked everywhere?\"\n\"Every part. Twice,\" Liam said.\n\"I know what I saw, Xavier.\"\n\"I got the test results back from the lab. And?\"\n\"The thing has all kinds of poisons. It definitely killed that animal, probably everything else around it. That's not the scary part. They may have found some human DNA.\"\n\"What? That thing didn't look like any human I've ever seen.\" One child said, \"I was going to wear the tie again, but then I thought, why bother?\" Another child replied, \"I came here this morning thinking you all would be strange people. But I've really changed my mind now. Really. One of you actually helped me understand. I think I get it now. You're all just people who want to find someone to share experiences with, right? So if you don't mind, I'd really like to keep coming back here for a while. I can share my stories with you. You can share your stories with me. And, who knows? Maybe together we could change the world.\" A child nodded and said, \"Okay. I think I have them right where I want them.\" Another child named Emma said, \"Madison...\" Madison replied, \"I know. You've done everything you could. I wish I could do more.\" A child exclaimed, \"Officer! We found something!\" Madison looked at something and said, \"Grace. It was caught down deep. Show me the face. I want to see the face.\" The officer said, \"It's alright. Get their ID. Check it against the missing list.\" Madison said, \"I was so sure.\" The officer replied, \"You were sure because you did see something. But it wasn't what you thought.\"", "hash": "fdfe65e0e571486eeced420df089e7f23a6324d7cfa02030d468a5ecf9a97f2f"}
