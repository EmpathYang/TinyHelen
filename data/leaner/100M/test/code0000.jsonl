Read all habits from the .habits file into a list.\n```bash  \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# read all lines of habits file into a list\nHABITS=( $(cat .habits) )\n```\n\n3. Make ways to add, remove, and check habits. The add_habit way asks the kid for a new habit, checks if it is already there, and adds it to the end of the .habits file if not. The remove_habit way takes a habit name and removes it from the .habits file. The check_habit way takes a habit name and says \"true\" if the habit is there, or \"false\" if not.  \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nadd_habit() {\n    echo \"Enter a new good habit:\"\n    read NEW_HABIT\n\n    # check if habit is already there\n    if grep -q \"$NEW_HABIT\" <(printf '%s\\n' \"${HABITS[@]}\"); then\n        echo \"That good habit is already there.\"\n    else\n        # add new habit to end of habits file\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$NEW_HABIT\" >> .habits\n\n        echo \"Added $NEW_HABIT!\"\n    fi\n}\n\nremove_habit() {\n    echo \"Enter a habit to remove:\"\n    read HABIT_TO_REMOVE\n\n    sed -i \"/$HABIT_TO_REMOVE/d\" .habits\n    echo \"Removed $HABIT_TO_REMOVE.\"\n}\n\ncheck_habit() {\n    local RESULT=\"false\"\n\n    for HABIT in \"${HABITS[@]}\"; do\n        if [[ \"$HABIT\" == \"$1\" ]]; then\n            RESULT=\"true\"\n            break\n        fi\n    done\n\n    echo \"$RESULT\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Use the ways to work with the .habits file. For example, after making some first habits, ask the kid to pick adding a new habit, removing an old one, or seeing their whole list of habits.  \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# make some first good habits (you can change these)\nINITIAL_HABITS=(\"Wake up early\" \"Drink water when awake\" \"Sit still for a few minutes\")\n\nfor INITIAL_HABIT in \"${INITIAL_HABITS[@]}\"; do\n    add_habit \"$INITIAL_HABIT\"\ndone\n\nwhile true; do\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"Pick one:\"\n    echo \"1.

It also has some helper things to keep track of the habits. \n\nWhen run, it first checks if a .habits file is there, and makes a new empty one if not. Then it reads all the habits from the file into a list named HABITS. Next, it makes the three ways to work with the habits file. Finally, it uses a loop to ask the kid to pick adding a new habit, removing one, seeing the list, or quitting the program. Depending on the pick, it calls the right way to update the .habits file or show information.", "hash": "308f479acb71f058a9a8d2e25a41a41ca7f2674e240ebd61047e762792e301ed"}

If so, it works out how many months are left, works out the interest for those months, and gives back the sum of all interest payments.

Here is what my graph might look like after making all these node and relation types:\n\n     ```\n     (Task:Thing {name:\"Learn New Things\"})-[Related_to]->(Topic:Thing{name:\"Graphs\"}) \n     \t|\n     \t|-->(Task2:Thing {name:\"Try New Code\"})-[Given_to]->(Person:Person {name:\"Alex\"})\n     \t|\n     \t|-->(Task3:Thing {name:\"Watch Videos\"})-[Watched_by]->(Person)\n     \t|\n     \t|-->(Event:Thing {name:\"Talk Time\"})-[Went_to]->(Person)\n     \t|\n     \t|-->(Course:Thing {name:\"Codes and Maths\"})-[Taught_By]->(Teacher:Person)\n    ```\n\n\n2 - Add sample data:\n\n    Now that we've made our node and relation types, let's add some sample data to our graph so we can test our code later. For example, here is how we could add some tasks, events, people and courses to our graph:\n\n    ```cypher\n    // Adding Tasks\n    CREATE (:Task {name : \"Study for Test\", description :\"Get ready for test by looking at notes and practice work.\"}),\n           (:Task {name : \"Write Code\", description :\"Start new work by making a new file and adding some code.\"}),\n           (:Task {name : \"Check Code\", description :\"Look at last day's work and make sure it is good.\"});\n    \n    // Adding Events \n    CREATE (:Event {name : \"Work Due\",description :\"Last day to hand in work.\", startTime : datetime(), endTime : datetime()}),\n           (:Event {name : \"Half Test\", description :\"Take test to check progress.\",startTime : datetime(), endTime : datetime() + interval '02 days'});\n    \n    // Adding People\n    CREATE (:Person {name : \"Jack\"}),(:Person {name : \"Jane\"}),(:Person {name : \"Bob\"}),(:Person {name : \"Sally\"});\n    \n    // Adding Courses\n    CREATE (:Course {name : \"Computers\"}),(:Course {name : \"Coding\"}),(:Course {name : \"Maths\"});\n    \n    // Making Relations between Nodes\n    MATCH (t1: Task), (t2: Task) WHERE t1.name = \"Study for Test\" AND t2.name=\"Check Code\"\n        CREATE (t1)-[:Comes_Before {weight: 1} ]->(t2);\n        \n    MATCH (e: Event), (p: Person) WHERE e.name = \"Work Due\" \n        CREATE (e)-[r: Went_to {importance:5}]-(p);\n        \n    MATCH (t: Teacher), (c: Course) WHERE t.name = \"<NAME>\" AND c.name =\"Computers\"    \n        CREATE (t)-[: Taught {pay:80000} ] ->(c);\n    ```\n    \n3 - Finding well-planned calendars:\n\n    To find well-planned calendars, we can use patterns to match, filters to check conditions, and functions to calculate scores based on things like event importance, duration, overlap, people going etc. For example, we could make a custom function which takes these factors and gives a score showing how well-planned the calendar is. Here is one way to do it:\n\n    ```cypher\n    /* \n    Function to calculate well-planned calendar score based on: \n    1. Importance of events \n    2. Length of events\n    3.

The code below asks a website called OpenWeatherMap for the weather words.\n```javascript  \nfetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${latitude}&lon=${longitude}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`)\n    .then((response) => response.json())\n    .then((data) => {\n      console.log(data);\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n      console.error(error);\n    });\n```\n\n3. To pick the right picture for the weather words, we can check what the words say:\n```javascript\nif (data.weather[0].description === 'clear sky') {\n  document.body.innerHTML = '<p>It looks like there will be <strong>sunshine</strong> today!</p>';\n} else if (data.weather[0].description === 'few clouds') {\n  document.body.innerHTML = `<p>Today might involve<br><span style=\"color: orange;\">${data.weather[0].description}</span></p>`;\n} else {\n  document.body.innerHTML = `<p>The weather seems uncertain,<br><span style=\"color: red;\">${data.weather[0].description}</span></p>`\n}\n```\nThis code looks at the weather words and shows a picture that matches. For example, if the words say \"clear sky\", it will show a picture of sunshine.\n\nWe made these choices so the picture matches the real weather. This way, people can see what the weather will be like where they live.\n\nAnother way to pick the picture is to look at all the possible weather words:\n```javascript\nconst descriptions = [ \n  \"clear sky\", \n  \"few clouds\",\n  \"scattered clouds\",\n  \"broken clouds\" ,\n  \"shower rain\",\n  \"rain\",\n  \"thunderstorm\",\n  \"snow\",\n  \"mist\"\n];\n  \nfor (let i = 0; i < descriptions.length; i++) { \n    const element = descriptions[i]; \n  \n    if (element === data.weather[0].description){ \n      document.body.style.backgroundImage = \n        \"linear-gradient(-45deg, #ee7752, #e73c7e, #23a6d5, #23d5ab)\"; \n      \n        break; \n    } \n}\n```\nThis code checks all the weather words one by one. If the real weather words match one of the words in the list, it will show a special picture.\n\nBoth ways work to show the right picture for the weather. The second way might be better because it does not need to be changed if new weather words are added.", "hash": "2b238a0e8f63b604dd04a2a15088f1bba5853ee16c6bc8780de3b8343d50ea67"}

This stops teeth and gums from getting sick. Cleaning teeth also makes your smile look white and good. Here are some other good things about cleaning teeth:\n\n    1. Stops Gum Sickness: Bad stuff next to gums can make gums sick. Gum sickness can make bones around teeth go away and even make teeth fall out if not fixed. Cleaning teeth stops this bad stuff before it starts.  \n    2. Stops Bad Breath: Food stuck between teeth can rot and make a bad smell. Cleaning teeth gets rid of this stuck food to keep breath fresh.\n    3. Makes Smile Look Good: Cleaning teeth helps keep them white by getting rid of stains from coffee, tea, and smoking. This makes your smile look nice.\n    4. Makes Brushing Easier: By getting rid of bad stuff, cleaning teeth makes brushing easier. This means you spend less time brushing but still get the same clean.\n    5. Makes Body Healthier: Gum sickness can make the whole body sick too, like the heart and sugar sickness. Cleaning teeth can help stop these other sicknesses.\n    \nIn the end, cleaning teeth is very needed to keep teeth and body healthy. While it may feel weird at first, the good things it does are well worth a little work.

The function checks if the input is between 0 and 1. If not, it shows an error note. If the input is good, the function uses a switch statement to change the marks based on the grade level. For instance, if the grade is 0, the new marks will be set to 5. However, if the grade is above 0 but less than a fourth, the new marks will be set to 8 times the grade plus 3. If the grade is between a fourth and three-fourths, the new marks stay at 9. Anything above three-fourths sets the new marks to 10. Finally, the function returns the new marks.\n\nNext, we make the main function which asks the child to enter a grade, calls the changeLowMarks() function with that grade, and shows the new marks. We also include some notes to help if the input is wrong. Overall, this code shows how to use if and switch statements to deal with different score levels based on a grade input.", "hash": "1b86ee2f20c1c4509ea2a4271dccf87fd615611f38a4a2fa5e74a1e739e4e51b"}

This way we can only use the areas a certain group is in charge of.\n\n    ```\n    // Details about Routes \n    (a:Route {start_time: '8am', end_time:'10am', duration: 2 hours})\n    (b:Route {start_time: '10am', end_time:'12pm', duration: 2 hours},\n     in_charge: 'State Road Crew')\n    (c:Route {start_time: '12pm', end_time:'2pm', duration: 2 hours})\n    ...\n\n    //Details about how Routes connect Places\n    (:Route {start_time: '8am', end_time:'10am', duration: 2 hours})-[connected for 5 miles]-(b:Place)\n    (:Route {start_time: '10am', end_time:'12pm', duration: 2 hours})-[connected for 8 miles]-(c:Place) \n    (:Route {start_time: '12pm', end_time:'2pm', duration: 2 hours})-[connected for 2 miles]-(d:Place)\n    ...\n    ```\n\n3 - We make rules so the data stays good. One rule is no Route can start and end at the same Place. Another rule is each pair of Places can only be connected once.\n\n4 - To find the shortest path between two Places, we can use a method called Dijkstra's algorithm. It keeps a list of Places it still needs to check. It picks the closest Place first and updates how far it needs to go to get to other Places from there. Once it finds the ending Place, it follows the path back to the start.\n\n5 - Here is an example of how to find the shortest path between two Places based on who is in charge:\n\n     MATCH path=(start:Place)<-[*]-(:Route)-[*]->(end:Place)\n     WHERE start.name='PlaceA' AND end.name='PlaceB' \n     RETURN path;\n\n     This finds all Routes and Places between PlaceA and PlaceB and returns the path.", "hash": "b1c6b3f2f1fae17096fd13222b94401a4c1afdc15ff31f1fa226d597ef006866"}

We then count the number of unique persons:\n\n        ```\n        MATCH (p:Person)-[:ObservedIn]->(b:Behavior)\n        WHERE b.name = 'WentOutdoor' \n        RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT p) AS TotalPeople\n        ```\n\n        To calculate the percent of people who did not touch their faces, we divide the total number of people who went outside by the total number of people who went outside AND touched their faces:\n\n        ```\n        MATCH (p1:Person {faceTouched: true}), (p2:Person)-[:ObservedIn]->(b:Behavior)\n        WHERE b.name = 'WentOutdoor'\n        WITH COUNT(DISTINCT p1) as FacedPeopleCount, COUNT(DISTINCT p2) as AllPeopleCount\n        RETURN round((AllPeopleCount - FacedPeopleCount) / AllPeopleCount * 100, 2) AS Percentage\n        ```\n\n    Q2: How many times did people report seeing others wash hands the right way compared to the wrong way?\n\n        To determine the number of right vs wrong handwashes, we make two separate patterns for right and wrong handwashing behaviors. Then, we combine these two patterns into one pattern matching both right and wrong handwashing behaviors:\n\n        ```\n        CREATE (yesHandwash:Outcome {name: 'Yes'}),\n               (noHandwash:Outcome {name: 'No'});\n               \n        MERGE (person1:Person)-[r1:ReportedTo {handWashedCorrectly: false}]->(noHandwash),\n            (person2:Person)-[r2:ReportedTo {handWashedCorrectly: true}]->(yesHandwash);\n        ```\n\n        This will result in two links between two persons where r1 has a value of noHandwash and r2 has a value of yesHandwash. We can now use the MATCH clause to count the number of distinct pairs of persons who had opposite outcomes:\n\n        ```  \n        MATCH (p1:Person)-[r1:ReportedTo]-(o1:Outcome),\n              (p2:Person)-[r2:ReportedTo]-(o2:Outcome)\n        WHERE o1 <> o2\n        RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT p1) AS WrongHands,\n               COUNT(DISTINCT p2) AS RightHands;\n        ```\n\n    Q3: Which things were linked to people reporting seeing others wash hands the right way?\n\n        For this question, we need to do a special study to identify which variables are significantly linked to proper handwashing behavior. One way to do this is to use the PIVOT operator to change our data from a table format to a matrix format, making it easier to apply statistical tests.\n\n        First, let's group our data by individual persons and compute the frequency of each possible combination of handwashing outcome and faceTouch status:\n\n        ```\n        MATCH (p:Person)-[:ObservedIn]->(b:Behavior)\n        WITH p, b, COLLECT({handWashedCorrectly: r.handWashedCorrectly,\n                            faceTouched: r.faceTouched}) AS reports\n        UNWIND reports AS r\n        GROUP BY p, r.handWashedCorrectly, r.faceTouched\n        ```\n\n        Next, we can use the PIVOT operator to convert this table into a matrix format where each column corresponds to a variable and each row corresponds to an observation:\n\nThe key things are:\n- Define the nodes/entities (Person, Outcome) and relationships (ObservedIn, ReportedTo) needed\n- Design a simple schema showing how these relate \n- Write queries to calculate percentage of people not touching faces, ratio of correct/incorrect handwashing reports\n- Do further analysis (like pivoting data) to identify factors linked to handwashing\n- Use very simple language and code comments throughout to explain things clearly", "hash": "62621fffac366038ed51e0fe24b583689614bc9ed69b744de84afbc60898d465"}

This function asks the user what they need by using gets.chomp. We then use if/else to check what the user said. If they said \"new\" we print out steps for new users on how to keep eyes clean when using eye pieces. This has simple steps like washing hands and cleaning the eye pieces each day. If they said \"some time\" we print out steps for users with some experience. This has more steps like soaking the eye pieces overnight. If they said \"long time\" we print out expert steps with things like wearing gloves and rubbing the eye pieces with a cloth.

{"prompt": "Make a way to change the times when buses or trains go to places. Use if or switch to deal with different cases based on what needs to be done. Write notes to explain why you do each thing.", "main_topic": "Transportation", "subtopic": "Public Transit Schedules", "adjective": "Extreme", "action_verb": "Update", "scenario": "for Decision Making", "target_audience": "Beginners", "programming_language": "Neo4j database and Cypher", "common_sense_topic": "Responsibility", "idx": 374642, "response": "Here is how I would change when buses or trains go to places:\n\n1 - Define Thing Types: \n\n    First we need to say what types of things are in our system. These could be Bus Companies, Routes, Stops, and so on. We also need to say how these things link together, like a Bus Company \"operates\" a Route, or a Route \"goes to\" a Stop. For example:\n\n    ```\n    (n0:BusCompany {name:\"New York Buses\"})\n    -(r0:operates)-\n    ->(s0:Stop)\n    <-[:goesTo]-(a0:Route {route_number:\"15\"}),\n    ...\n    ```\n\n2 - Put in Schedule Info:\n\n    We can put schedule information into things that are routes and stops. We do this by linking them together based on their times. Here is an example for putting in route information:\n\n    ```\n    UNWIND $routes AS r\n    MERGE (a:BusCompany{name:$companies[$i]})\n    ON CREATE SET a.website = $websites[$i], a.phone=$phones[$i]\n    MERGE (r:Route {company:a, route_number:$numbers[$i], name:$names[$i]})\n    ON CREATE SET r.type=$types[$i], r.color=$colors[$i]  \n    WITH a,r\n    UNWIND $stops AS stp\n    MATCH (st:Stop{stop_id:stp.stop_id})\n    WHERE NOT EXISTS((r)<-[sr:goesTo]-(st))\n    MERGE (r)-[sr:goesTo]->(st)\n    ON CREATE SET sr.name=stp.name\n    SET r += $props\n    RETURN count(*)\n    ```\n\n3 - Look for Things to Change:  \n\n    To look for things that need to be changed, we can use `MATCH` to find the affected routes and stops. Then we can change their details. For example, let's say we want to change all New York Bus routes that go through Times Square on weekdays to be subways instead of buses because of construction work:\n\n    ```\n    MATCH (a:BusCompany {name:'New York Buses'}),\n           (r:Route)-[:goesTo*..10]<-(:Stop {stop_id:'Times Square'})\n    WHERE Monday TO Friday IN range(date(), date() + 7 days)  \n    SET r+={type:'Subway', company:{name:'New York Subways'}}\n    return count(*);\n    ```\n    \n4 - Deal With Problems:\n\n    Sometimes there may be problems that need special actions. For example, let's say there are two bus companies running one route, but only one gave updated schedule information. In this case, we could add extra instructions to choose the company with the newest information:\n\n    ```\n    // Choose which company to use if they give different schedules\n    MATCH (r:Route {route_number:'X98'}),\n          (a1:BusCompany)-[:operates]->(r),\n          (a2:BusCompany)-[:gave_new_schedule]->(r)\n    WHERE a1.last_update < a2.last_update  \n    SET a1:use_this_company;\n    ```\n    \nIn summary, to change when buses or trains go places we need to keep track of routes, stops, and companies in a database. By using the database's way of linking things together, we can look for things that need changing and change them. We can also add special instructions for when there are problems like companies giving different schedules.", "hash": "6033d856753b1435d7ef97ad0ad3f9167c8eed171b2f5eae2cb4cd6bf4ed29f0"}

To check if someone has good tooth habits, we can use code like this:\n\n    ```python\n    person_id = 1\n    \n    print(\"Good habits for strong teeth for person\", person_id)\n    \n    for habit in good_habits:\n        habit_id = good_habits.index(habit) + 1\n        score = next((s[\"score\"] for s in scores if s[\"person\"] == person_id and s[\"habit\"] == habit_id), 0)\n        \n        print(habit[\"habit\"], \"-\", habit[\"note\"])\n        \n        if score >= 4:\n            print(\"  You do this habit well!\")\n        elif score >= 2:\n            print(\"  You can do this habit better.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  You need to start doing this habit.\") \n            \n    print(\"Keep up the good work for strong teeth!\")\n    ```\n\n   Where \"1\" is the ID of the person whose tooth habits we want to check. This code prints all the good habits along with notes and how well the person with id=1 does each habit.\n\nLet's think step-by-step:", "hash": "0604c1783f0cce0bf7f75bc4998db8fef7cf61762c9e30f6475caffb7f86b0a7"}

It uses a function checkJob() that prints \"FAILED\" or \"PASSED\" based on the worker's result.\n\nThen, the code makes changes based on each worker's job using the changeData() function. If a worker \"Did something wrong\", it prints \"Stop working until checked\" and calls stopWorker(). Otherwise, it calls warnWorker().\n\nThe stopWorker() and warnWorker() functions are not shown, but their names explain what they would do.\n\nThe comments explain the purpose of each part of the code in simple terms a child could understand.", "hash": "9f6923415750039bfa3266b9723d7bd02da435951215872d2d25c51a23b57967"}

If their teeth are very bad, it tells them to go to a special doctor right away to get their teeth fixed.\n\nThe ```getTeeThInfo()``` function uses some helper code to get a number for how bad the person's teeth are overall. It does this by calling ```getNumberForHowBadTeethAre()```, which adds up all the \"how bad is it\" numbers for each tooth and divides by the total number of teeth to get an overall \"how bad\" number. ```getTeeThInfo()``` then uses that overall number to decide if the teeth are good, not good but not too bad, or very bad.\n\nI made the descriptions and code as simple as I could while still explaining what it does.
