{"text": "Lesson: Old Cars and Playing with Them\n\n## Section 1: What is an Old Car?\n\nOld cars are special cars that are not made anymore. People like to keep them because they look nice and are rare. These cars are very old, sometimes 20 years old or more!\n\n## Section 2: Fun Examples\n\nOne old car is a special car from long ago. It was made for only two years and not many were made. People love it because it looks cool and goes fast. Another old car is the first small sports car made by a big car company. It was also made for just two years. People like it because it's different and important from a long time ago.\n\n## Section 3: Playing with Old Cars\n\nPlaying with old cars can be fun but you need to learn a lot about them. It's good to know why some old cars are special because they are rare, look really good, or are just like when they were new. But, old cars can sometimes break and fixing them can take a lot of time and money.\n\n## Small Words to Know\n\n- Rare: When there are not many cars like it, it's special.\n- Looks Good: How nice the car looks.\n- Just Like New: Old cars that look like they did when they were new are extra special.\n- Fixing: Making the car look new again, which can cost a lot of money.\n- Getting More Valuable: When the car becomes worth more money as it gets older.\n- Getting Less Valuable: When the car becomes worth less money as it gets older.\n\n## Ending\n\nPlaying with old cars can be lots of fun if you like how they look and their history. By knowing what makes an old car special, you can choose the best ones and have a great time with your hobby.\n\n<end>Lesson: Learning About Wrong Information\n\nIntroduction:\nSometimes people share stories that aren't true without meaning to. It's important to know when a story is not true so you don't get confused.\n\nSection 1: What is Wrong Information?\n\nTopic 1: Kinds of Wrong Information\n- Made-up Stories: Stories made to trick people.\n- Mistakes: When someone shares something by mistake.\n- Mean Information: When information is used to be mean or trick others.\n\nTopic 2: Where Wrong Information Comes From\n- Places like websites where we talk to friends.\n- Places where we read news.\n- Talks and Rules\n\nTopic 3: Ways People Might Not Tell the Truth\n- Saying things bigger than they are\n- Not telling the whole truth\n- Using numbers to trick\n- Saying mean things about others\n- Making you feel strong feelings\n\nSection 2: How to Know if Something is Not True\n\nTopic 1: Finding Out if Something is Not True\n- Check where the story came from\n- Look at different places to see if they say the same thing\n- See if the story doesn't make sense or has parts that don't match\n- Use special websites that help find out what's true\n- Think about how the words are used\n\nTopic 2: What to Do if You Hear Something Not True\n- Share things that are true\n- Tell others the right thing if you hear something wrong\n- Talk nicely to understand better\n- Use facts when you talk about things\n- Think hard about things before you believe them\n\nTopic 3: How to Act When You Hear Something Not True\n- Don't pay attention to it\n- Show it's wrong with facts\n- Talk to clear up wrong ideas\n- Tell someone who can fix it\n- Teach friends how to find out what's true\n\nConclusion:\nIt's hard to know if something is true or not, but it's very important. By learning about how some people might trick us, where stories come from, and how to check if they're true, we can be better at knowing what to believe. Always check facts, use good reasons, and talk nicely to make sure we all know what's really true.\n\nGlossary:\n- Wrong on purpose info: False facts made to trick people\n- Not sure if true info: Facts that someone didn't mean to get wrong\n- Harmful info: Facts used to hurt or trick people\n- Mean words about someone: Being unkind about someone instead of talking about their ideas", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 947, "idx": 351830, "original text": "Jay Leno collects them, and so does Jerry Seinfeld. Both entertainers are classic car enthusiasts. Their collections are worth millions. What do they know that we don't? As a rule, cars are not good investments. But, classic cars are different. A car's scarcity has a major impact on the vehicle's value. For example, you can buy a run-of-the-mill 1967 Mustang for a few thousand dollars or a much rarer 1969 Shelby for $185,000 [source: Shelby Mustang].. Experts say that vintage cars have outperformed stocks in the past few years [source: Lubove]. Determining the value of a classic car is not an exact science. Cars that originally commanded high prices, such as Ferrari and Rolls Royce, tend to appreciate more than cars whose original value was moderate. In addition, the more original parts a car has, the more the vehicle is worth. Repairing body damage and painting the car its original factory color will also enhance its price..

In this lesson, we will learn how these tiny particles talk to each other and work together.\n\nPart 1: Tiny Particles - The Basics\n\nTopic 1: Particles Can Be Wavy or Little Balls\nTiny particles can act like waves or like little balls. We can think of them as being able to be in more than one place at a time.\n\nTopic 2: Particles Can Be in Many States\nParticles can be in more than one state at the same time. This is because they are a bit like waves, which can spread out.\n\nTopic 3: Particles Can Be Connected\nSometimes, two or more particles become so connected that what happens to one can affect the other, even if they are far apart.\n\nPart 2: How Particles Talk to Each Other\n\nTopic 1: Particles Send Signals\nParticles talk by sending signals to each that only they can understand.\n\nTopic 2: Strength of Talking\nThe strength of their talking depends on their special signal strength.\n\nTopic 3: Particles and Light\nSometimes, when particles send signals, they use light. This light can carry energy from one particle to another.\n\nPart 3: Fun Uses of Particle Talking\n\nTopic 1: Super Fast Computers\nThere are special computers that use the way particles talk to do things very fast.

Thus, the QDAT has both unitary and non-unitary processes, the former being force-type interactions mediated by virtual photons and the latter being radiative processes in which energy is transferred via real photons. The nature of the so-called light-tight box condition for the quantum level is clarified, and it is noted that no particular cosmological structure is required for this to be fulfilled.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a semiconductor device and fuse blowout method. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a current blown fuse and a fuse blowout method.\n2. Description of the Background Art\nIn a semiconductor device of a large capacity recently developed, it is technically difficult to fabricate all memory cells of a memory unit without problems to operate normally, and in the case where a failure memory cell is found in the fabrication stage, a memory array (column array, row array) having the failure memory cell is replaced with a spare memory array prepared in advance. For this purpose, redundant circuits of memory arrays in the number estimated from the rate of failure are prepared.\nThis prevents a semiconductor device itself from being a failure product and allows increase in a manufacturing yield of the semiconductor device.\nThe connection and disconnection between the memory array having a failure memory cell and the spare memory array are switched by a fuse. Generally, a column decoder and a row decoder of the peripheral circuits are configured so that the memory array having a failure memory cell cannot be selected while a spare memory can be selected by blowing the fuse.\nThe fuse blowout methods include a method using the laser beam and a method using electricity. The blowout method using the laser beam poses the problem that the fuse for the semiconductor device only in wafer form can be blown out and the process is complicated.\nIn the electrical blowout method, on the other hand, the fuse for the semiconductor can be blown out not only in wafer state but also after being packaged.\nFurther, the electrical blowout method is roughly divided into two categories.\nOne category is what is called the antifuse method using a fuse of a structure having electrodes arranged with an insulating film therebetween, in which the states of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d are programmed by impressing the two electrodes with such a voltage as to cause the dielectric breakdown of the insulating film. The other method is a current blown fuse method using a fuse having the configuration of a conductive layer, which is programmed by blowing out the fuse with at least a rated current.\nThe current blown fuse is configured of a linear fuse portion actually blown out and fuse lead portions at the ends of the fuse portion. The fuse portion is designed to be thinner than the fuse lead portions. This is in order to increase the current density locally by efficient joule heat generation in the fuse portion and to facilitate the blowout of the fuse portion with a small current.\nIn this way, the current blown fuse is blown out utilizing the joule heat generation by the current supplied. The blowout of the fuse, therefore, requires a current of at least several tens of mA, which in turn requires a power supply having a large current output, and the effect that the heat generated by the fuse blowout has on the environment poses a problem.\nIn order to solve these problems, the reduction of the current required for fuse blowout is effective, and a fuse structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 06-140510 (1994), for example, has been proposed as a method to reduce the current.\nSpecifically, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 06-140510 (1994) discloses a technique in which the fuse portion assumes no simple linear form, but includes at least one crank portion at which the current is concentrated to increase the current density, so that the fuse is blown out with a small amount of current.\nJapanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 03-28737 (1991) (FIGS. 1, 2), on the other hand, discloses a structure in which the fuse portion is folded back with a plurality of turns into a meandering form to reduce the occupied area.\nIn Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 06-140510 (1994), as shown in FIG. 2, the current density increases in the crank portion. In the other portions, however, the current density decreases and the effect of the current density increases in the crank position is offset. As compared with the linear fuse, therefore, no conspicuous effect is not expected.\nIn Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 03-28737 (1991), on the other hand, the fuse assumes a meandering form to reduce the occupied area. The effect of reducing the blowout current, however, is not clear, and it is concluded that the blowout current is not reduced for not less than a predetermined length of the fuse portion. Therefore, the fuse structure is not considered to have been optimized.", "hash": "c9075c6a0ae0ba8353d1663bf91c863072d779cdd1f399aa23348efa246754f2"}

A day Kaitlyn Swonke never thought she'd see come. Compassionate Cultivation, the first medical marijuana dispensary in the state, opens southwest of Austin Thursday.\"It's been a difficult journey,\" said Swonke, 21. Eyewitness News first met Kaitlyn in 2015, one year after she was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy. Her uncontrolled seizures have landed Kaitlyn in the hospital more times than she can count. She's undergone six brain surgeries and countless prescription drug changes.\"When epilepsy hits a household, it affects everyone in the house,\" said Kellie Swonke, Kaitlyn's mom.Traditional medicine hasn't help control Kaitlyn's seizures. But now, she has new hope: Medical marijuana.\"I'm so excited. It means I can come off all my medications, or even just one!\" Kaitlyn said, talking to ABC13 at her Spring home.Thursday, the first medical marijuana dispensary opens in Texas. Compassionate Cultivation is located in Manchaca, about 25 minutes south of downtown Austin. They will only sell one product: Low level THC cannabis oil that will not get you high.\"We are entering our vegetative room,\" Taylor Kirk said, as he walked an ABC13 crew into a room filled with dozens of baby marijuana plants growing under bright green light. Kirk supervises all the cultivation at the dispensary. He gave a tour of the grow process.Currently, they have five rooms that house medical marijuana plants. Four months ago, on Halloween, they planted the first seed. It was the day Compassionate Cultivation received their medical marijuana license from the state, thanks to the Texas Compassionate Use Act.Under the bill, the only people who legally get a prescription and purchase the oil are those with intractable epilepsy, like Kaitlyn. Perspective patients must live in Texas, visit one of 17 state-approved doctors and get approved by a second doctor. There are five doctors in Harris County.The doctor enters a prescription into a statewide database and one can pick it up at a dispensary. Compassionate Cultivation delivers anywhere in Texas three days a week for $25.\"When I tell people this is happening in Texas, they're like, 'Are you kidding me? Texas?'\" said Garret Nicodemus, COO. \"I think more and more people are getting on board with it.\"As of Dec. 15, 2017, DPS has issued three dispensing organization licenses: Cansortium Texas was licensed Sep. 1, 2017; Compassionate Cultivation was licensed Oct. 31, 2017; and Surterra Texas was licensed Dec. 15, 2017.\"To be able to help people, that's something I've not been able to do in my career before,\" Kirk said, leading us to another grow room.Inside Compassionate Cultivation, it looks more like a Pottery Barn magazine than a dispensary. The small waiting room has white walls with gray furniture.\"It feels like a doctor's office, very much so, in that regard,\" said Cullen Vujosevic, who mans the front desk.No bottles of cannabis oil are shelved in the open.The place operates like a pharmacy, not a smoke shop. Nicodermus hopes that changes the way Texans think about medical marijuana.\"By highly regulating it, by ensuring that the products going out the door have to meet certain specifications, you make the confidence level for both the patient and prescribers that much higher,\" Nicodermus said.As for Kaitlyn and her mother, they believe this is just the beginning of medical marijuana acceptance in Texas. They would like to see doctors have more control over the THC level allowed in cannabis oil. Right now, the government mandates oil have .5 percent THC. That amount is different from state to state. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical that makes you feel high.\"But it's a good first step,\" Kellie Swonke said.ABC13 reached out to Governor Greg Abbott about the dispensary opening. His office did not immediately respond with our request for comment. But in 2015, when he signed the Compassionate Use Act, he opposed blanket legalization of marijuana, as well as what he called use of \"conventional marijuana\" for medical purposes.In 2015, the Texas Sheriff's Association published a lengthy report with their take on medical marijuana. They say it needs to be studied more to see exactly how it helps kids with epilepsy.", "hash": "89cd3ff1ca74480455643dce476f7adff8cfcd325a1d031397288224be87d8fc"}

By trying hard in school, you can change the world.\n\nSection 2: Fun Examples\n\nTopic 1: Math Games\nLet's think about how doing well in school can help you grow. Imagine you are learning about math and find a tricky idea. At first, it is hard. But you keep trying and studying it. Soon, you know it well and can solve hard problems. This skill helps you stand out when you want a job and can open doors to work in areas like computers and building things.\n\nTopic 2: Learning About the World\nAnother way doing well in school can help you grow is by learning about the world. Imagine you are learning about how our bodies work. You find out about how we can fight sickness and stay healthy. You decide to learn more about this and become a top person in this area. Your work helps make new treatments for sickness and makes life better for lots of people.\n\nSection 3: Wrapping Up\n\nIn the end, doing well in school is key for growing and doing well at work. By trying your best, you can learn to be disciplined, confident, and focused. You can also help others by using what you know to do good things for the world around you. Whether it's through math games or learning about the world, trying your best can lead to great things. So, always aim high and do your best.\nContribution: the act of giving or providing something (like toys or help) to others\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned that trying our best in school is very important. When we try hard, we can grow and become better at things. This helps everyone around us too. By doing our best, we can do great things and help make the world a nicer place.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 881, "idx": 211655, "original text": "Shauna Lake: One of the things I was interested when I was reading up on you, it's not just the academic program, it's the ballroom dance, it\u2019s the sports it feels like every little thing that UVU touches and is involved in has expanded and really blossomed.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Fun Helping Day\n\nIntroduction:\nHelping days are a fun way to help others and share about something important. In this lesson, we will learn how to make a fun helping day. We will talk about these things:\n\n1. Making Plans\n2. Telling Others\n3. Doing and Checking\n\n1. Making Plans\n\nA. What is it For?\nThe first thing to do is to think about why you are having this helping day. Do you want to collect money, tell more people about something, or get helpers? Once you know why, you can start to make plans.\n\nB. How Much Will it Cost?\nNext, think about how much money you need. You might need money for a place to meet, snacks, decorations, and signs. Always save a little extra money just in case you need more later.\n\nC. Pick a Fun Theme and Place\nPick a fun theme that fits what you are helping with. Then, choose a place to meet. It could be a big room, a park, or a place where your community gathers.\n\nD. Ask for Helpers\nAsk for helpers to make your helping day happen. You might need people to help set up, welcome guests, and clean up. You can also work with other groups to help more people come and bring more things you need.\n\nE. Plan to Tell Others\nMake a plan to tell others about your helping to day. You can use pictures and words on the internet, send notes, and even tell news places to help spread the word. Tell them why the helping day is important and how they can be part of it.\n\n2. Telling Others\n\nA. Use the Internet\nThe internet is great for telling lots of people about your helping day. You can put pictures and words on sites like Facebook or Instagram to tell people, answer questions, and get them excited.\n\nB. Send Notes\nSending notes is another good way to tell people. Write messages and send them to people to tell them about your helping day and how they can join in.\n\nC. Work with Shops\nShops near you can help tell more people about your helping day. They can give things for games or help tell more people by putting up signs.\n\nD. Tell News Places\nNews places like newspapers and TV can help a lot of people learn about your helping day. Write to them and tell them about what you are doing and why it is good.\n\nIII. Doing and Checking Your Work\n\nA. Do Your Plan\nOn the day of the big help day, do your plan well. Make sure all helpers know what to do, and everything goes as planned. Have another plan ready just in case something unexpected happens.\n\nB. Check How Well You Did\nAfter the big help day, check how well it went. Did you reach your goals? Did you collect the money needed? Were the people who came happy and involved? Use what you learn to make future help days even better and keep making a difference.\n\nConclusion:\nPlanning and running a successful help day takes time, care, and planning. By following these steps, you can make a help day that collects money and tells more people about your good cause while making sure everyone has a good time. Always look for ways to do even better next time.\n\nGlossary:\n- Cause: A good cause or group you help.\n- Money: Money collected for a special reason, like helping a good cause.\n- Knowing more: Helping more people understand and know about a cause or problem.\n- Helpers: People who give their time and help for a good cause or big day.\n- Partners: Groups or companies that work with you to help your cause or big day.\n- Sharing the word: Telling more people about your big day to bring them in.\n- Talking online: Using websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to share news and connect with more people.\n- Email sharing: Using emails to tell more people about your big day and talk to them.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 470, "idx": 367499, "original text": "Friday, April 9, 2021.

{"text": "Lesson: Finding Good Info on the Internet\n\nIntroduction:\nThese days, the internet is a great tool to find things out. But there's a lot on there, and it's hard to know what's true. In this lesson, we'll learn how to tell if the things we find online are something we can trust.\n\nSection 1: Checking if Online Things Are True\n\nTopic 1: Why it's important to check online things\n\nQuestion: Why do we need to make sure online things are true?\nAnswer: It's important because not everything online is right or true. By checking, we make sure we use facts and true things, which help us make good choices.\n\nTopic 2: Signs that online things might not be true\n\nQuestion: What shows us that something online might not be true?\nAnswer: Signs include stories that seem too shocking, no proof or facts, just what someone thinks, old news, and different facts from what trusted places say.\n\nTopic 3: Knowing if the writer knows a lot\n\nQuestion: How do we know if the writer knows a lot about what they wrote?\nAnswer: We can check if they went to school for it, what jobs they've had, and if they belong to professional groups. We can also look at other things they've written about the same topic before.\n\nSection 2: Learning About Good Websites\n\nTopic 1: Knowing Good and Fun Websites\n\nQuestion: What is different between good and fun websites?\nAnswer: Good websites are made by people who know a lot about a topic. They check their work before sharing. Fun websites are for everyone to read and enjoy. They might not check facts as much. Good websites are usually better to trust.\n\nTopic 2: Finding Good Websites\n\nQuestion: What are some good websites?\nAnswer: Good websites are ones like government sites or school sites. Big news places like news channels are also good. These sites have correct information most of the time.\n\nTopic 3: Checking Info in Different Places\n\nQuestion: Why should we check info in different places?\nAnswer: Checking info in different places helps us know if it's right. By looking at different places, we can see if they all say the same thing. This helps us make good choices.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned how to pick good websites and tell which ones we can trust. We also learned how to check if information is right by using different sources. This helps us learn better and make smart choices when we use the internet.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 619, "idx": 207959, "original text": "1169 Product ResultsSkip results filters and go to sorting options Skip results filters and go to results list.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Moving and Mixing Tiny Things\n\n## Section 1: What are Tiny Moving Things?\nTiny moving things is about how tiny bits that are too small to see move around and touch each other. It's a way to learn about how everything that we can touch and feel acts on the very small level.\n\n## Section 2: Simple Examples\nLet's think about tiny bits in a box. If the box gets warmer, the tiny bits move faster and bump into each other more. This is because they have more energy when it's warmer.\n\nNow think about tiny bits in water. The bits are close and move around, changing the shape of the water. This is different from how they move in the air.\n\nAnd then, think about tiny bits in a stone. They dont move much; they just shake a little in their spots. This is because they are packed very tightly.\n\n## Conclusion\nToday, we talked about how tiny things that are hard to see move and interact. We looked at examples like tiny bits in a box, water, and a stone.\n\n## Section 3: Understanding Things Around Us\nWe can learn about how things work, like how building materials stay strong in hot or cold weather. This helps people make better things for different places.\n\n## Section 4: Thinking Carefully\nLearning about how things work is tricky. We should always ask questions like: Why do people use certain ways to do things? What is good or not so good about these ways?\n\n## Simple Words\n- Moving and mixing: How tiny bits of things move and stick together.\n- Energy measure: How much energy something has.\n- Same state group: A bunch of tiny things all doing the same thing.\n- Path: The way something moves.\n- Probability path: The likely way some tiny things move together.\n- Special math function: A special way to use math to guess about tiny bits.\n\n## Ending\nToday we learned about how tiny bits of things move and work together. We also talked about how to think better about different ways to do things.

This alternative formalism has distinct advantages for propagating distribution functions represented by finite trajectory ensembles and for nonpolynomial potentials.

This lesson will show you how to look for things you want to know using different ways.\n\n## Section 1: Why Things are Important\n\nThe first thing to learn is why knowing things is important. Knowing things helps us choose, learn, and know what is happening around us. But not everything we find is good to know, so we need to learn which things are right to trust.\n\n## Section 2: Where to Find Things\n\nAfter you know why things are important, you need to know where to find them. You can find things in books, newspapers, and on the internet. Each place has good and not-so-good points, and you need to know which place has the things you need.\n\n## Section 3: How to Use Search Tools\n\nSearch tools on the internet help us find things fast. But they can give us too many things sometimes. To use search tools well, you need to know how to pick the best words to help you find just what you're looking for.\n\n## Section 4: Checking if Things are True\n\nIt's important to check if the things you find are true. You need to look at who wrote it, if it's new or old, if it's about what you need, and if it just tells facts.\n\n## Section 5: Keeping Up-to-Date\n\nFinding things is not just for one time; you need to keep looking for new things. To stay up-to-date, you can set alerts or follow pages that tell you new things often.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, knowing how to find things you need to know is a big help.

We will learn better words to use.\n- Instead of saying someone is \"slow,\" we can say they \"learn differently\" or \"need more time to learn.\" This is nicer and makes everyone feel respected.\n\nWhat to Remember:\n- Always use words that are kind and show you care about other people's feelings.\n- If you want to talk about someone who learns in their own special way, you can say they have \"unique learning needs\" or that they \"learn differently.\"\n\nBeing Respectful:\n- If you are talking about a friend at school who needs extra help, you can say they have \"a special way of learning.\" This is a respectful way to talk about it.\n- Using kind words helps everyone feel important and respected.\n\nQuestions:\n- What are some kind words we can use instead of \"slow\"?\n- Why is it good to use kind words?\n\nUsing kind words is very important.

Clinical signs were recorded and water consumption was measured daily; does were weighed on GD 0, 6-19, 25, and 30. At necropsy (GD 30), maternal liver, kidney, and gravid uterine weights were recorded. Histopathologic examination was performed on kidneys from 10 does/dose and for all unscheduled deaths.

The \"no observable adverse effect level\" (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was therefore 1000 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was at least 2000 mg/kg/day in this study. The sensitivity of NZW rabbits relative to that of Sprague-Dawley rats and Swiss mice for maternal and developmental toxicity from gavage administration of EG during organogenesis can be determined for maternal toxicity: rabbits > mice > rats, and for developmental toxicity, mice >> rats >> rabbits.", "hash": "f592840214351fef968094ae0ab15c55f5a5653a06b25e8e7fb54f5545c40314"}

We see new things in phones, helping doctors, and keeping our planet safe.\n\n**Section 2: Why are New Things Important?**\nNew things help us solve problems, make life better, and help the world. They let us talk to people far away, learn about anything, and make new things that make us happy. They also help more people find jobs.\n\n**Section 3: How Do New Things Happen?**\nNew things happen by thinking about what we already know and finding new ways to use it. People who know a lot about science and building things make new things that help us all.\n\n**Section 4: Examples of New Things**\nOne example is cars that dont need gas but use electricity. People who know a lot about science made a special kind of battery for these cars. These cars are good for the air because they dont make dirty smoke.\n\n**Section 5: Thinking About New Things**\nWhen we learn about new things, we should think about how they can help us but also if they might cause problems. Like with robots that can think, they can do great things for health, but we need to make sure they keep information safe.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, technology and innovation are important parts of our world today.

{"text": "Lesson: The Importance of Architectural Restoration\nIntroduction:\nBuilding beautiful places is important for everyone, and it is special to keep old buildings looking nice to remember the stories of a place. This lesson talks about how we fix and keep old buildings looking nice and important.\n\n**Part 1: Learning About Fixing Old Buildings**\n*What is Fixing Old Buildings?*\nFixing old buildings means making sure they look like they did a long time ago and work well too. We fix the building parts that are broken and make the building pretty and important again.\n\n*Why Do We Fix Old Buildings?*\nIt's important to fix old buildings because it helps us remember the stories and history of a place. It stops old buildings from being destroyed and used for new things. Fixing old buildings also brings in visitors who want to see them, which is good for the place.\n\n**Part 2: How Architects Help Fix Old Buildings**\n*Why Architects Are Important*\nArchitects know a lot about buildings, how they look, and their history. They help figure out what's wrong with an old building, plan how to fix it, and make sure it looks good and works right after fixing.\n\n*How Do Architects Fix Buildings?*\nArchitects check the building, make a fixing plan, do the work, and watch to make sure everything goes well. They work with history experts and builders to make sure the building looks and works like it did before.\n\n**Part 3: Examples of Fixed Buildings**\n*The Library*\nThe library in a cold country was old and broken but architects and history experts fixed it up. Now, it looks great and people are happy about it.\n\n*The Big Old Arena*\nThere is a very old arena in a city called NE city. It was broken but got fixed. Now, it's safe for people to visit and see how it looked a long time ago.\n\n**In Summary:**\nFixing old buildings is a way to keep our history and stories alive. Architects and other experts help make sure these buildings stay beautiful and useful. We learned about why and how we fix old buildings and some real buildings that have been fixed.\n\n**Words to Remember:**\n- **Fixing Old Buildings**: Making old buildings look and work as they did in the past.\n- **Old Building**: A building that is important because of its history or design.\n- **Stories and History**: The unique stories that tell us about the past of a place.\n- **Keep Safe**: Protecting something from being lost or ruined.\n- **Make Like New**: Making something look and work as it did when it was new.\nA big plan: A plan that covers everything about a project or fun activity.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5465, "idx": 330324, "original text": "Augvape Boreas RTA Review\n\nAugvape Boreas RTA Intro\n\nThe Boreas is an RTA from Augvape, a Chinese vaping hardware manufacturer. It was designed by Augvape and Roxy, who is a member of Vaping360\u2019s family of writers/contributors. With a 25mm diameter and 8ml capacity, the Boreas is the big brother tank to Augvape\u2019s other recent RTA, the 23mm/3ml Alleria, from the same design team. (I\u2019ve reviewed the Alleria separately because the two tanks vary considerably in design, features, and construction.)\n\nNotable Remarks\n\nPrice\n\nThe Boreas RTA is available online for prices ranging from $35\u2013$40. Shipping may be extra.\n\nFeatures\n\nAugvape Boreas RTA Taken Apart\n\nThe Boreas has all the features that are rapidly becoming standard among this new generation of superior RTAs: stainless steel construction, top fill, a huge 17mm Velocity-style deck with dual posts, each of which has two large holes with side-mounted grub screws for a wide variety of builds, plus an eliquid feed system through holes in the floor of the deck (2.0mm on the standard deck, 2.5mm on the higher wattage/high VG deck). A parts bag is included with a hex wrench, four grub screws, and a generous supply of additional O-rings. Instructions are sparse, but YouTube reviews are a good resource for information about construction and how to build coils on the Boreas. The entire tank dismantles for easy cleaning.\n\nAll parts of the tank are machined with great precision and buttery smooth threads. Eight air intake holes \u2014 four on each side of the tank base below the deck \u2014 are infinitely adjustable via control ring that\u2019s firm to turn, but not stiff. The tank sat perfectly flush on my RX200 and was a good match to that powerful, large mod.\n\nDeck\n\nAugvape Boreas RTA Decks\n\nThe spacious 17mm Velocity-style deck is a joy to build. Designed for dual coils, the deck will accommodate almost any wire size and coil builds from simple to exotic. I chose the simple route (typical for me) of 26-gauge stainless steel spaced coils, seven wraps each at 3.0mm inner diameter, for an overall resistance of 0.29 ohms, with Kho Gen Do cotton wicking. Since eliquid is fed to the coils through holes in the deck\u2019s floor, wicking is straightforward and not at all finicky. Use an ample amount of wicking material, then tuck the wick ends under the coils, and the tank is good to go.\n\nPerformance\n\nAugvape Boreas RTA Airflow\n\nEven with my simple build, the Boreas performed brilliantly. I found my preferred draw with 2-3 holes open on each side. I tried wattages from 50 to 75, which was about the limit of the wicking capabilities. Had I used the alternate deck with its larger 2.5mm feed holes, the wicking flow would probably be maintained even at power limits well in excess of 80 watts. That\u2019s for those who like to walk on the wild side and push the envelope, of course; I was totally happy at 65 watts using the standard deck.\n\nFlavor and vapor production were as good as any RTA, RDA, or sub ohm tank I\u2019ve tried. Impeccable. Stunning. Delightful.\n\nWith my modest, simple dual-coil build, the Boreas was thirsty, but not voracious about drinking eliquid. More exotic builds or higher power vaping would probably increase the rate of eliquid consumption. That\u2019s no surprise, though. Lovers of aggressive, high-end builds are prepared to go through eliquid like crazy. It comes with the territory of current vaping technology.\n\nI tested the Boreas to confirm that MTL vaping was possible at lower power (under 40 watts) with only one air intake hole open. In fairness, however, it\u2019s designed for direct-lung vaping, and that\u2019s where it shines.\n\nThe air intake is ganged with the internal eliquid flow control. Adjust the air intake, and the flow of eliquid to the coils changes accordingly. With only a single adjustment to be concerned with (the air intake ring), operation of the tank is simplified, but with no loss of sophistication or performance.\n\nInstructions in the package state that the air intake should be closed off to half a hole when filling the tank to prevent leaks, and that\u2019s advice to be taken seriously. The one time I forgot to close of the air intake when refilling, the tank leaked eliquid out the air holes for a couple minutes before the internal pressure re-stabilized. The leaking wasn\u2019t a flood, and I don\u2019t regard it as a major flaw, but it was messy enough to teach me not to forget again.\n\nOther than that \u2014 which was my own fault \u2014 I have nothing but praise for this amazing RTA.\n\nLikes\n\nInnovative Design\n\nImpeccable Manufacturing\n\nSpacious deck is a joy to build\n\nHolds a ton of eliquid (8ml)\n\nTotally smooth draw at every adjustment, from wide-open to almost closed\n\nPerformance is brilliant, providing a full, rich vaping experience\n\nDislikes\n\nLeaks after filling if the air intake isn\u2019t shut off\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Augvape Boreas is every bit as good as my earlier 25mm large tank champ, the SMOK TF-RTA, and with a much larger eliquid capacity: 8ml versus 4.5 for the similarly-sized TF-RTA. I\u2019m not ready to crown the Boreas as the new heavyweight champeen, but if this were a prize fight, Las Vegas bookmakers would give even betting odds.\n\nRecommended for You\n\nMy name is Bill. I\u2019ve been a dedicated vaper for five and a half years, having ended a 35-year addiction to tobacco cold-turkey on my first day of vaping. I live on the Oregon coast, in the tiny town of Florence, one huge sand dune away from the Pacific Ocean.", "hash": "8b04abc5eb31e84f58292395e995ed57f5d1e8efee6d77b45630cc7ad17f6477"}

What it means to fix things.\n2. Why fixing things is important.\n3. Different ways to fix things.\n4. How to fix things.\n5. Stories of fixing big things.\n\n### Section 1: What it means to fix things?\n\nFixing things means making sure buildings and big things are safe and strong after they get hurt by storms, bad building, or not taking care of them. When we fix things, we find out what went wrong, see how bad the hurt is, and make it all better.\n\n### Section 2: Why fixing things is important?\n\nFixing things is very important because it stops them from getting worse, keeps people safe, and keeps the building's worth. If we don't fix problems, it could cost a lot more later or the building could fall down. This is very dangerous if people live there, work there, or play there.\n\n### Section 3: Different ways to fix things\n\nThere are some ways to fix things:\n\n1. Crack fix: This means closing cracks in walls or floors with special stuff to make them strong again.\n\n2. Bottom fix: Sometimes the bottom part of a building gets hurt by water or dirt moving. We make it strong again.\n\n3. Top fix: Fixing the roof if it leaks or gets broken by the wind.\n\n4. Keep water out: We put a special coat on walls and floors so water can't get in and cause damage.\n\n5. Make stronger: We add extra stuff to make the building stronger and hold up better.\n\n### Section 4: How to fix things\n\nTo fix things, do these steps:\n\n1. Look carefully: Check the building well to find all the damage and what caused it.\n\n2. Make a fix plan: Use what you learned from looking to make a plan with steps, things you need, and tools for fixing.\n\n3. Get ready: Clean up the place so nothing is in the way. Keep safe the places around from getting hurt while fixing.\n\n4. Do the fix: Follow the plan and use the right tools and stuff to repair. Make sure you do it the best way that is known.\n\n### Section 5: Stories of fixing big things\n\nSometimes, big things like bridges or tall buildings need fixing too. We can learn from stories about how other people fixed these big things. It helps us understand why it's important to do a good job and make things safe again. Test the fix: Once the fix is done, try it out by doing different checks like water checks.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 1029, "idx": 437024, "original text": "ADDRESS. - Address: 43 St. Jacks Road,.

{"text": "Lesson: About Bike Helmets\n\nIntroduction:\nBikes are fun to ride, and wearing a helmet is very important to keep safe. In this lesson, we will learn about different bike helmets, what they are like, and how to pick the best one.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Bike Helmets\n\nThere are three main kinds of bike helmets: full head, flip-up, and half.\n\n1. Full Head Helmets: These helmets cover your whole head and keep you very safe. They have a part that protects your face from wind and little things flying in the air. Full head helmets also have a shade that can move to keep out sun or rain.\n\n2. Flip-Up Helmets: These helmets have a part that can move up and down at the back. You can lift up the front part of the helmet. Flip-up helmets keep you as safe as full head helmets but are easier to use when you are not riding.\n\n3. Half Helmets: These are also called open-face helmets and only cover the top part of your head. They don't protect as much and are usually worn for style or during short rides when the weather is nice.\n\nSection 2: Things to Look For\n\nWhen picking a bike helmet, think about these things:\n\n1. Safety Tag: A helmet with a safety tag shows it meets safety rules and keeps you safe.\n\n2. Shield: A helmet with a shield helps protect your eyes from the sun, wind, and rain.\n\n3. Air Holes: Look for a helmet with air holes to keep your head cool while riding.\n\n4. Fit: Make sure the helmet fits well and feels comfortable without being too tight.\n\n5. Bright Colors: Pick a helmet in bright colors or with stickers so it's easier for others to see you.\n\nSection 3: How to Pick the Best Helmet\n\n1. Measure your head: You can use a string or go to a store to find out how big around your head is.\n\n2. Try on the helmet: The helmet should sit straight on your head and not move too much. Make the straps snug but not tight.\n\n3. Check if it's comfy: Wear the helmet and move your head to make sure it doesn't hurt or feel uncomfortable.\n\n4. Listen: While wearing the helmet, cover your ears and talk. If you can't hear yourself, the helmet might be too noisy.\n\nConclusion:\nUnderstanding bike helmets is important for riders who want to be safe. By knowing about the different types, what to look for, and how to pick the right one, you can choose the best helmet for you. Always wear a helmet when riding a bike to help keep you safe in case of a fall.\n\nGlossary:\n- DOT: Department of Moving Things\n- Snell: Snell Helping Group\n- Visor: A clear or colored thing on a helmet that keeps eyes safe from sun, wind, and tiny bits flying around.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 836, "idx": 391650, "original text": "Newsletter Keep up to date with the latest motorcycle and Bikebiz news.

{"text": "Lesson: Oil Pipes and Nature\n\nIntroduction:\nOil pipes are big tubes that carry oil from where it is found to places where it is made into fuel. But, these pipes can hurt nature and people, especially the groups who have lived on the land for a very long time. We will learn about how oil pipes can hurt nature and these groups.\n\nSection 1: How Oil Pipes Hurt Nature\n\nTopic 1: Leaks and Spills\nOil pipes can break and spill oil. This spill can dirty the ground, water, and air. It can hurt animals, plants, and even make people sick.\n\nQuestion: How do oil spills make nature sick?\nAnswer: Oil spills cover animals and plants with oil, break their homes, and dirty their food. They can also make rivers and lakes dirty and unsafe.\n\nTopic 2: Building Oil Pipes\nMaking oil pipes can also hurt nature. Cutting down trees to make space for pipes can destroy animal homes. Making pipes can also put dirt and harmful stuff into the air and water.\n\nQuestion: What happens when we build oil pipes?\nAnswer: Cutting trees can take away homes from animals and make the air dirty. Digging for pipes can also make underground water dirty.\n\nSection 2: How Oil Pipes Hurt People\n\nTopic 1: Land Rights\nGroups who have always lived on the land might lose their connection to it because of oil pipes. This can cause arguments about who owns the land and disturb their way of living, like hunting and farming.\n\nQuestion: How do oil pipes change peoples connection to land?\nAnswer: Oil pipes can be built on land that has been used by these groups for a long time. This can cause disputes about land rights and disturb their normal activities.\n\nTopic 2: Health and Safety\nThese groups might get sick from oil spills or leaks. Touching or breathing in oil can cause breathing problems and skin issues. Also, making oil pipes can lead to accidents and hurt people.\n\nQuestion: How do oil pipes make people sick?\nAnswer: Oil spills can put harmful chemicals in the air, water, and ground, causing health problems. Building pipes can also be dangerous and lead to accidents.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, oil pipes can hurt nature and people. They can cause spills and leaks that damage the environment and hurt groups who live close by. They can also take away their land and make their lives harder. It's important for us to know about these problems and look for safer ways to move oil.\n\nGlossary:\n- Pipes: long tubes that carry oil from where it is found to places where it can be made into fuel.\n- Spill: when oil accidentally comes out of the pipes.\n- Home: where plants or animals live.\n- Dirty: when harmful things get into places they shouldnt be.\n- Bad stuff: things that make places dirty.\n\nDiscussion:\nAre pipes that carry oil good or bad?\n\nGood Things:\n- Pipes help move oil to make fuel which we use every day.\n- They make sure we have enough fuel.\n\nBad Things:\n- Sometimes, pipes can break and oil can spill, making the land and water dirty.\n- This can hurt the land and people who have lived there a very long time.\n\nConclusion:\nPipes that carry oil can be helpful, but they can also cause problems.

{"text": "Lesson: Fun with Colors and Shapes\n\n### What We Will Learn\nToday, were going to learn about a fun kind of art that uses colors and shapes to make pictures that might not look like things we see every day.\n\n### What to Know\n- Fun Art: This art uses colors and shapes in special ways to make pictures.\n- Shape Art: This art doesnt show real things but uses shapes like circles and squares.\n- Color Art: This art uses big patches of colors to show how they look together.\n\n### Story\nA long time ago, some artists decided to make art that wasnt about showing things like trees or dogs. Instead, they used colors and shapes to show feelings or ideas. Some artists known for this are Kandinsky and Pollock.\n\n### What Makes It Special\nThis kind of art is special because it shows us that art doesnt have to be about things we can see. Its more about playing with colors and shapes.\n\n[PARAGRAPH]### Artists\nSome of the most influential abstract artists include William, Kevin, Peter, and Jack. William is known for his colorful, flowing pictures that show feelings and ideas through color and shape. Kevin is famous for his Black Square, which he thought was the first completely abstract picture. Peter's pictures, made of lines and rectangles, are very famous and easy to recognize. Finally, Jack's drip pictures, made by dripping or pouring paint on a canvas, show his new way of making art.\n\n### Examples\nHere are a few examples of abstract art:\n\n1. William's Big Colorful Picture: This picture doesn't show things or ideas that we can recognize. It uses colors, shapes, and lines to make a lively picture that shows the artist's feelings and thoughts.\n\n2. Kevin's Black Square: This picture uses a simple square shape to make a strong picture.\n\n3. Peter's Picture with Red, Yellow, and Blue: This picture uses big areas of color to make a whole picture.\n\n4. Jack's Number 1, 1950 (Soft Purple Picture): This picture uses drips and pours of paint to make an exciting and expressive picture.\n\n### Glossary\n- Abstract Art: Art that does not show real things but uses colors, shapes, and forms to make a picture.\n- Picture: A piece of art made by an artist.\n- Color: What we see when light hits an object and comes back to our eyes.\n- Shape: The form of something in a picture.\n- Idea: A thought or plan.\n- Feeling: What we feel like happy, sad, or excited.\n\n### Conclusion\nAbstract art is a very special and interesting kind of art that many artists and people like. By learning about abstract art, we can enjoy its beauty and learn new things. This lesson has taught us about the important ideas and artists of abstract art, and now we can learn more about this wonderful type of art.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 800, "idx": 365230, "original text": "Richard Serra: Torqued Ellipses.

Ba2+ concentrations in the active layer ([Ba2+]) were measured using the ion-probing/Rutherford backscattering spectrometry procedure reported in our previous work. We found that at all but the lowest experimental pH 3.42, [Ba2+] was lower than the corresponding total concentrations of R-COO- groups; their difference was consistent with steric and charge effects determining the accessibility and association, respectively, of Ba2+ to R-COO- groups. Accordingly, we propose two descriptors, the accessibility ratio (AR) and the neutralization number (NN), to account for the observed difference. AR, the fraction of R-COO- groups accessible to Ba2+ ions, and NN, the average number of R-COO- groups neutralized per Ba2+ ion, were determined experimentally performing Ag(+)-Ba2+ ion-exchange tests. The resulting AR = 0.40 indicated that on average only 40% of ionizable carboxylic groups were accessible to Ba2+.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Fishing\n\n## Section 1: What is Fishing?\nFishing means catching fish with a hook and line or other tools. You can fish in rivers, lakes, and big water like oceans. To fish well, you need to know what fish do, what to use to catch them, and the best time and place to go fishing.\n\n## Section 2: How to Fish\nTo fish, you need these things: a fishing pole, a reel, a line, a hook, something for the fish to want (like worms), and a net to catch them. You also need to know the rules about fishing where you live and maybe get a special paper that says you can fish.\n\nWhen you're ready, go to a place where there are fish. Look for little waves on the water or birds that might be looking for fish too. Throw your line into the water and wait for a fish to nibble. When a fish bites, pull it in slowly and carefully.\n\n## Section 3: Tips for Fishing\nAs you keep fishing, you'll learn how different fish act and the best ways to catch them. Some people who fish for bass use a small thing to catch them near plants or rocks. Others who fish for big fish like salmon drag a bait behind their boat.\n\n## Words to Know\n- Fishing pole: A long stick you use to send the line into the water\n- Reel: A thing that holds your fishing line\n- Line: A string or rope that connects the bait to your reel\n- Hook: A sharp metal piece that catches the fish\n- Bait or lure: Something you use to make the fish come to your hook, like worms\n- Fishing net: A big bag with holes to scoop up fish\n\n## Ending\nFishing is a fun thing to do by yourself or with friends. By knowing about fish and using the right tools and ways, you can catch more fish and have a great time outside.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 767, "idx": 320202, "original text": "Hey fellas, I just got accepted into the U.S. Army JAG Corps.

{"text": "Lesson: Sharing Toys and Playing Fair\nIntroduction:\nSharing toys is important when playing with others. It helps everyone have fun and makes playtime fair.\nWhat is Sharing?\n1. Sharing means letting others play with your toys while you play too.\n2. It shows you care about your friends' feelings.\n3. It helps stop fights over toys.\nWhy Sharing is Good:\n1. Everyone gets a turn: When everyone shares, all kids get to play with different toys.\n2. Makes friends happy: Sharing can make your friends smile and feel good.\n3.

This can make it hard for people in one country to sell their things in another country, and can make some toys and foods more expensive or harder to find. \n\nWe will learn about why countries might not agree on trading. \n\n**What is a trade disagreement?**\nA trade disagreement happens when countries can't agree about how to exchange things like toys and food. They might disagree because they have different rules about how things should be made or taken care of.\n\n**Why do trade disagreements happen?**\nCountries have disagreements because they have different ideas about what is best for their people. Some countries might want to make sure their toy makers can sell lots of toys, so they might not want toys from other countries to come in easily. Other countries might want lots of different toys from everywhere.\n\n**How do these disagreements affect farmers and toy makers?**\nFarmers and toy makers can have a tough time when there are disagreements. If a country puts a big tax on toys coming in, toy makers might not sell as many toys. This means they might earn less money. The same goes for farmers. If another country makes it hard to sell fruits like cherries, farmers might get less money for their fruits.\n\n**Real examples with toys and fruits:**\nIn one year, a big country decided to charge more money for cherries from a place where lots of cherries grow. This made it hard for cherry farmers because not as many people wanted to buy their cherries, and they lost a lot of money.\n\nAnother example is with toy makers who use metal to make their toys. One year, it became more expensive to get metal from another country because of extra charges. This made it hard for toy makers to keep making toys without spending more money, and some had to make fewer toys.\n\nKnowing about these disagreements can help us understand why sometimes toys and foods might be more expensive or harder to find.\n- Sanctions: Rules given to a place or person for not following the big rules.\n- Retaliate: To answer back when someone does something not nice.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 888, "idx": 108667, "original text": "Washington\u2019s Apple and Cherry Industry Wary of Trade War.

These rules stop any one business from controlling everything, which helps buyers get better choices and fair prices. The main goal is to make sure all businesses can do well and come up with new ideas.\n\n### Section 2: Why is Fair Play in Business Important?\nFair play in business is very important because it keeps our shopping world healthy and fair.

By following these rules, we make sure businesses treat everyone nicely and play fairly.\n\n### Section 3: Stories of Fair Play in Business\nA famous story is about a big company called \"Big Tech Company\" in the US. The government said that \"Big Tech Company\" was not playing fair because it was too controlling. The judges said they needed to play nicer with others.\n\nAnother important story is from a long time ago, called the \"Big Fair Play Rule of 1890.\" This rule was made when a few big businesses were controlling too much, and it helped stop that. Since then, this rule has helped in many situations where businesses were not playing fair.\n\n### Section 4: Conclusion\nKnowing about fair play in business is very helpful for understanding how businesses should treat everyone nicely and fairly.

{"text": "## Lesson: Exploring Houses\n### Introduction\nExploring houses means learning about different places where people live. Houses can be big or small and are made to keep us safe and warm. This lesson will help you understand what makes a house and how people create homes.\n### Section 1: What is a House?\n- What are houses?\n- Why do people need houses?\n- What makes a house a home?\n### Section 2: Types of Houses\n- Houses with big gardens\n- Tall buildings with many homes\n- Small houses just right for small families\n### Section 3: How Houses are Made\n- Building the walls\n- Putting on the roof\n- Making rooms inside\n### Glossary\n- House: A place where people live\n- Home: Where you feel safe and loved\n- Family: People who care for each other\n### Conclusion\nExploring houses shows us how people live in different kinds of homes. Houses protect us and give us a place to be with our family. Remember, a house is made special by the people who live in it with love.\n\n### Topic 4: Why Some Choices Can Help People Save Money\nSometimes, when people buy houses, they can make choices that help them save money when it's time to pay taxes. This is really helpful for people who earn a lot of money because they usually have to pay more taxes. Also, this choice can help them slowly own more of their house, because they can use the money they saved to pay for the house.\n\n### Topic 5: What Can Be Hard About These Choices\nEven though these choices can save money, they can also be risky. If the value of houses goes down, the person might not be able to sell their house for more money than they paid. They might also lose money if their other things that cost money don't do well.\n\n### Conclusion\nBuying houses and making smart choices can really help in saving money and making more money in the long run. By knowing the simple parts of these choices and planning well, you can do really well and reach your big dreams.\n\n## Simple Words to Know\n- Buying Houses: When people buy places to live hoping they will be worth more money later.\n- Saving Money on Taxes: Making choices so you don't have to pay as much money when it's time to pay taxes.\n- Owning a House: Slowly making a house really yours by paying for it over time.\n- Making Money from Selling Things: When you sell something like a house for more than you paid, you make money.\n- Planning: Thinking and making decisions about how to do something well.\n[PARAGRAPH]- Net Operating Income (NOI): The income generated by an investment property, after accounting for all operating expenses but before accounting for financing costs, taxes, and depreciation\n- Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM): A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as the purchase price divided by the expected rental income over a specific period\n- Cap Rate: A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as the net income divided by the property value\n- Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV): A measure of the risk of a loan, calculated as the loan amount divided by the property value\n- Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR): A measure of an investment's ability to cover its debt obligations, calculated as the net income divided by the total debt service\n- Cash Flow: The income received from an investment, after accounting for all expenses\n- Appreciation: The increase in the value of an asset over time\n- Depreciation: The decrease in the value of an asset over time, due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or age\n- Inflation: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, therefore, the purchasing power of currency is falling\n- Market Value: The estimated worth of a property, based on current market conditions\n- Capitalization Rate: A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as net income divided by the property value\n- Cash on Cash Return: A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as the cash flow divided by the cash invested\n- Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR): A measure of an investment's ability to cover its debt obligations, calculated as the cash flow divided by the total debt service\n- Net Operating Income (NOI): The income generated by an investment property, after accounting for all operating expenses but before accounting for financing costs, taxes, and depreciation\n- Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM): A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as the purchase price divided by the expected rental income over a specific period\n- Cap Rate: A measure of the rate of return on an investment, calculated as the net income divided by the property value\n- Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV): A measure of the risk of a loan, calculated as the loan amount divided by the property value\n- Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR): A measure of an investment's ability to cover its debt obligations, calculated as the net income divided by the total debt service\n- Cash Flow: The income received from an investment, after accounting for all expenses\n- Appreciation: The increase in the value of an asset over time\n- Depreciation: The decrease in the value of an asset over time, due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or age\n- Inflation: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, therefore, the purchasing power of currency is falling", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 362, "idx": 223947, "original text": "Investors.

{"text": "Lesson: How Big Things Travel Around the World\n\nIntroduction:\nThe world is always changing, and it's important to know about these changes. This helps us make good choices every day. Today, we will learn about how big things like machines and large parts move from one place to another across the world. We will talk about the different ways these big things travel and the big boats that help carry them.\n\nSection 1: What Changes in the World?\n\nTopic 1: What are changes in the world?\nChanges in the world mean how things in the world become different over time. These changes can be good or bad and can affect many things, including how big items travel.\n\nTopic 2: How do changes in the world affect how big things travel?\nIf a place has less money to spend because it is going through a hard time, it might not send as many big things to other places. This means fewer big boats are needed to carry these things.\n\nTopic 3: What are some examples of these changes?\nSome examples include when rules of trade change, when the value of money goes up or down, or when people decide to buy different things.\n\nSection 2: The Big Boats That Carry Big Things\n\nTopic 1: What is a big boat that carries big things?\nA big boat that carries big things is a special kind of ship that can carry very large items that do not fit in normal containers. These items are usually lifted onto the ship with big cranes.\n\nTopic 2: Why are these big boats important?\nThese big boats are very important because they carry large things needed for big projects like making roads, bridges, and power stations. Without these big boats, it would be very hard and expensive to build these things.\n\nTopic 3: How do changes in the world affect these big boats?\nJust like other things, these big boats are affected by changes in the world. For example, when a place is doing well and has more money, it might build more things, so more big boats are needed. But if a place is not doing well, fewer big boats are needed.\n\nSection 3: New Paths for Ships\n\nTopic 1: What are new paths for ships?\nNew paths for ships are new ways that ships can travel from one country to another. These new paths are made because of changes in the world or to reach new places.\n\nTopic 2: Why are these new paths important for carrying big things?\nThese new paths are important because they let big boats carry large things to new places where they are needed. This can make people want more shipping services and help businesses make more money.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 997, "idx": 458601, "original text": "Rotterdam remains upbeat on prospects.

{"text": "Lesson: Looking at Pictures of Buying and Selling Things\n\n## Introduction\nWe learn how to look at pictures to understand how people buy and sell things. We use pictures, lines, and special marks to guess if the price of things will go up or down.\n\n## I. Understanding Pictures\n\n### A. What are these pictures?\nThese pictures help us see how prices of things change. They use lines and shapes to show us if things are getting more expensive or cheaper.\n\n### B. How do pictures help?\nPictures help by showing how prices have changed before to guess what might happen next. They use lines and shapes to show where prices might go up or down.\n\n### C. Why are pictures helpful?\nPictures are helpful because they let us make good choices about when to buy or sell things. They give us a way to look at how prices change and find good times to buy or sell.\n\n## II. Looking at Pictures\n\n### A. Looking at Charts\nCharts are pictures that show prices of things at different times. They help us see if the price is going up, going down, or staying the same.\n\n### B. Finding Patterns\nPatterns are shapes in the charts. They help us guess if prices will go up or down. Some shapes might tell us prices are going up, others might tell us they are going down.\n\n### C. Using Special Marks\nSpecial marks are like secret codes that help us learn more about prices. They use numbers to tell us more about how prices are moving.\n\n## III. Trying it Out with Real Things\n\n### A. Example 1: Toy Coins\nLet's pretend we are using pictures to guess if toy coins will become more expensive. We look at the picture and see it has been going up. We think it might keep going up.\n\n### B. Example 2: Toy Blocks\nLet's pretend we are using pictures to guess if toy blocks will become more expensive. We look at the picture and see it has been going up. We think it might keep going up.\n\n## IV. Talking about a big helper\n\nWhen we talk about how things like computers and printers talk to each other, it's like magic but easier to understand! Imagine lots of toys that can share their secrets and play together. That's what we call a \"big helper\" in school!\n\n## Fun Time\n\nLet's think about a place in school where there are many computers. These computers can talk to a special computer that keeps all the games and stories they need to learn and have fun. When a friend wants to read a story on the computer, the special computer quickly sends it to them. This is a fun way of computers helping us learn.\n\n## Everyday Help\n\nIn many places like hospitals and factories, computers help people share important things like health tips and help make cars. They talk to each other to make sure everything works well.\n\n## Easy Words\n\n- Big Helper: Computers and printers talking and sharing.\n- Special Computer: A big computer that helps the other computers.\n- Friend: A computer asking for help.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nKnowing about these big helpers is very useful. They help us share stories and do important work together.

When we have information in different lists and we want to put them together, we can use a special way to combine them. This helps us see connections between the things in the lists. \n\n### Example Time\nImagine we have one list with kids' names and another list with their favorite games. We want to know which games each kid likes. We can connect these two lists using the kids' names.\n\n### Everyday Examples\nLet's think about a toy store.

Rakudo is an\nimplementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see \n<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for this release\nis available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.\n\nPlease note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star\ndistribution[*] -- it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.\nFor the latest Rakudo Star release, see\n<http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.\n\nThe Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each\nrelease named after a Perl Mongers group. The June 2012 release is\ncode named after Strasbourg, the location of the French Perl Workshop 2012.\n\nThis release includes a lot of changes since the last one, including:\n\n* Longest-Token Matching for | alternations in regexes\n* Stricter numification of strings (fails if the string does not\n  represent a number)\n* 'require' now allows argument lists\n* Faster .map / list handling\n* Improvements to typed exceptions\n\nThis is only a small peek at the changes in this release.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About True Stories\n\nIntroduction:\nTrue stories are all around us. They teach us about the world and show us real things that happen. In this lesson, we will find out how to understand and think about true stories.\n\nSection 1: How True Stories are Put Together\n\nTrue stories are written in a special way to share facts and real things. They start with an introduction that tells us what we will learn about. Then, they have parts that give more details, and end with a closing part that wraps everything up. The middle parts of the text give more details about the topic, and the last part wraps everything up nicely.\n\nActivity:\n- Look at this story and see how it is built.\n- What part starts the story? What are the middle parts? What part ends the story?\n- How does the way the story is built help share information well?\n\nText:\nStart: We read non-fiction books a lot. They tell us about the world, help us understand big ideas, and share what other people go through.\n\nMiddle Part 1: A type of non-fiction book is a life story. It talks about a person's life from when they are very little to when they are grown up.\n\nMiddle Part 2: Another kind of non-fiction book is a guide. Guides tell us how to do things, like put together toys or make food.\n\nEnd: In the end, non-fiction books are great for learning and knowing more about the world.\n\nAnswer:\nStart: The start tells us what we will learn about in the story.\n\nMiddle Part 1: The middle parts give us lots of information about the topic.\n\nEnd: The end tells us what we learned.\n\nThe way the story is built helps us understand the topic well by laying it out clearly.\n\nSection 2: Understanding Stories\n\nTo really get non-fiction books, we need to think about what we read. This means asking questions, connecting ideas, and remembering what we read.\n\nActivity:\n- Read this story carefully and answer the questions.\n- Who wrote \"A famous drama\"?\n- What is the main person's name?\n- How is the main person like?\n- What is the big problem in the story?\n\nText: \"A famous drama\" is a book by Jack. The main person is named Harry, who is a young boy living in NE city. Harry is unsure, alone, and not happy with grown-ups. He feels sad and like he doesnt fit in. The big problem is Harry trying to feel okay after his little brothers passing and feeling out of place.\n\nAnswer:\n- Who wrote \"A famous & drama\"? Jack\n- What is the main persons name? Harry\n- How is the main person like? Unsure, alone, and not happy with grown-ups\n- What is the big problem in the story? Harry's struggle with his little brothers passing and feeling out of place\n\nSection 3: Looking at Non-Fiction Texts\n\nLet's read and think about a story called \"a famous book.\"\n\nActivity:\n- Let's talk about this story.\n- Why is the story's name important?\n- How does the main boy act with others?\n- What is the big idea of the story?\n\nText: \"A famous book\" is a story about a boy named Henry. Henry is a young boy living in NE city. Henry does not trust grown-ups and feels very alone. He is sad and feels like he doesnt fit in anywhere. Henry has a hard time because he misses his little brother and feels different from everyone.\n\nAnswer:\n- Why is the story's name important? The name is about a song Henry hears wrong. He thinks the song talks about saving children from a dangerous fall. The name shows Henry wants to keep children safe and feels alone.\n- How does Henry act with others? Henry doesn't trust easily and keeps to himself. He doesnt make friends because he doesnt share much about himself.\n- What is the big idea of the topry? The big idea is about trying to find meaning and friends in a place that feels empty and fake. Henry feels alone and sad, which is a problem many people have when they dont feel connected to others.\n\nConclusion:\nReading and talking about stories helps us learn about the world.

It\u2019s a great insider\u2019s look into one of the fastest growing social networks by a former senior engineer. The book is fascinating because it captures the author\u2019s experience at the best moment, immediately after the party comes to an end. It\u2019s written by an insider who\u2019s been an outsider from the day he joined as a 30-something engineer that was clueless about the true power of the product he was working on under a boss roughly two thirds his age. To be perfectly blunt, the writing style of the book is a bit amateurish and the author tries to cram too many half-digested lessons in entrepreneurship into the narrative. But perhaps, that\u2019s part of the charm and genuineness of the book, an ordinary engineer at the right place at the right time swept up into one of the most amazing periods in a company\u2019s history. It\u2019s probably the most revealing and best look we\u2019ll ever get of what it was like to be at Facebook in the early days and a story that none of the more key members of the team would not be able to tell because they lack the detached perspective.\n\nTo be fair, despite the heavily promotional nature of the site, you can tell that the author still cares deeply about the company he was with. Almost like a jilted lover who wishes well from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nI found a lot of interesting bits in this book and it was a fascinating read. Here are some of the things I walked away with.\n\nThe Facebook Founder is fearless\n\nMark Zuckerberg developed Facebook like no other can. Young, brilliant, and not dumbed down into submission by a college education, Mark put Facebook onto a good start by taking a no holds barred approach from Facebook\u2019s inception. In the early stages he scraped Harvard student data and spammed friends (I use the word spam loosely). He was even brought before Harvard\u2019s administration for these breeches but unlike most, Mark never looked back.\n\nFast and Loose Coding\n\nThe site had over 2.5 million members at the time, and well over a billion pageviews per month. Yet there was no source control and code changes were all made as root.\n\nThat pretty much sums up how fearless they were coding the application. Of course, they did later migrate to source control (programs to keep track of changes you make to an application\u2019s source code) but they were also adventurous in moving to PHP5 when it was released. Facebook mainly hired on youth and brilliance rather than experience and qualifications. Facebook also gave them enough space to run free with their ideas and see their code make a dramatic impact on the community.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say their code sucked. In fact, it was most likely the opposite. What they lacked in standard source management practices was adequately compensated for by the technical excellence of their engineers.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think it all comes down to the fact that Facebook was built for the very audience they cater to and by fearless and brilliant engineers who weren\u2019t bogged down by \u201creal world experience\u201d to guide them in what they could or couldn\u2019t do. They went against all textbook notions of how to develop and market a traditional tech startup while staying true to the spirit of truly successful startups before them like MI company and GO company.\n\nWould I buy this book? I probably would if I didn\u2019t have this promo but a smaller excerpt. The juicy bits were a priceless read and this will be the only book you will get it from for some time to come.\n\nFacebook is really doing some exciting things as evidenced by their personal feeds (which made pageviews sky rocket) and opening their API like no other platform instead of dancing a murky tango with third-party developers like MySpace. Yet at the end of the day it will always be people and only about people on the inside and outside. Facebook certainly has potential to be the social backbone that other social apps launch off of. I can only hope that Facebook continues to attract genuine talent that genuinely care like the author of this book.", "hash": "c524afd8d2ee2b4613b287a393dd9464c6332777d4ba823b83dd304b4ab8a7c6"}

{"text": "Lesson: Sharing Pieces\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we're going to learn about sharing pieces by dividing fractions. It's like sharing your toys with friends so everyone gets an equal part. We will start by understanding what it means to share, then learn how to share using fractions, and try some examples.\n\nWhat is Sharing?\nSharing is like if you have one cookie and two friends, you break the cookie so each friend gets a piece. When we use numbers, we call it dividing. If you have 10 toys and share them with 2 friends, each friend gets 5 toys.\n\nSharing with Fractions:\nWhen we share using fractions, we have a special way to do it:\n\n1. Make sure both fractions are talking about the same thing, like both talking about pieces of cake.\n\n2. Flip the second fraction upside down and multiply it with the first one. This is like doing a special trick to find out how many pieces each friend gets.\n\n3. Now, you can see who gets more pieces or if everyone gets the same. We will learn how to share one number with another using small pieces.\n\nLet's see an easy way:\n\nExample: \nShare 3/4 with 1/2\n\nStep 1: Find a number that both small pieces can fit into evenly. Both pieces fit into 8, so we keep them the same.\n\nStep 2: Change the pieces so we can share easily.\n\n(3/4) * (2/2) = 6/8\n(1/2) * (4/4) = 2/8\n\nStep 3: Take away the smaller part from the bigger part.\n\n6/8 - 2/8 = 4/8\n\nSo, 3/4 shared with 1/2 gives us 4/8 or 1/2.\n\nPractice Questions:\n\n1. Share 7/12 with 3/8.\n2. Share 5/9 with 1/3.\n3. Share 2/5 with 3/7.\n\nWe learned how to share numbers by using small pieces, changing them, and taking away the smaller part from the bigger part. We also practiced to understand better. This helps us share numbers easily.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 325, "idx": 151306, "original text": "The students will be able to divide fractions..

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Photography\n\n## Section 1: What is Photography?\nPhotography is when you catch light with a camera to make pictures. You can do this with a digital camera or with film. When you take a picture, you think about where things are in the picture, how light or dark it is, what is clear and what is not, and how the light looks.\n\nWhere things are in the picture is really important. Taking good pictures can make them look nice and tell a story better.\n\nHow bright a picture is depends on how much light gets to the camera. It's important to get this just right to show what you see.\n\nHow clear a picture is also matters. A good picture has the main thing looking very clear and the rest a bit fuzzy.\n\nThe light in a picture helps make it look nice. Good light can make a picture feel happy or cozy.\n\n## Section 2: Let's See an Example\n\nLet's look at a picture to understand these ideas.\n\nIn the picture, the main thing is not right in the middle, which makes it look good. The light is just right, not too bright or too dark. The main thing is very clear. The light is soft and makes the picture feel warm and welcoming.\n\n## Section 3: Using These Ideas\n\nImagine taking a picture of a friend at the beach.\n\nFirst, think about where to put your friend in the picture. Maybe in front with the ocean and sky behind. Next, make sure the picture isn't too bright. Keep your friend looking clear, especially if they are moving. Think about the light too. Even though there's sunlight, you might want to use something to make the light even better.\n\n## Words to Know\n\n- How things are placed in a picture.\n- How bright the picture is.\n- How clear the picture is.\n- The kind of light in the picture.\n\n## To Finish\n\nTaking pictures is a fun way to keep memories.

{"text": "Lesson: Moving - How To Find a Home in a New Place\n\nIntroduction\n\nMoving is a big step that is exciting but can also make you feel nervous. When you move to a new city, finding a home is important but can be hard if you are new. In this lesson, we will give you some tips on how to find a home in a new place.\n\nSection 1: Knowing What You Need\n\nThe first step in finding a home in a new city is to think about what you need. This means deciding on the kind of house you want, like a house, an apartment, or a small house with many homes. You should also think about how big the home should be, where it should be, and what things you need in your home.\n\nQuestion: What kind of house do you like? \nAnswer: A house just for one family. \n\nQuestion: How big should the house be? \nAnswer: It should have 3 rooms. \n\nQuestion: Where do you want the house to be? \nAnswer: Near the middle of the town. \n\nQuestion: What things do you want near your house? \nAnswer: A park. \n\nSection 2: Finding the Right House Helper\n\nA house helper is very important when you want to buy a house. They can help you look for houses that are right for you and show you how to buy one. When you don't know the place, a good house helper is very helpful.\n\nQuestion: Why do you need a house helper when you buy a house? \nAnswer: A house helper can help you find the right house and show you how to buy it. \n\nQuestion: How can you find a good house helper? \nAnswer: You can ask people you know, look online, or use a house website. \n\nSection 3: Learning About the Area\n\nBefore you buy a house, you should learn about the area to make sure it's right for you. This means looking at how safe it is, how good the schools are, and what things there are to do.\n\nQuestion: Why should you learn about the area? \nAnswer: It helps you know if the place is right for you and your family. \n\nQuestion: What should you check about the area? \nAnswer: How safe it is, how good the schools are, and what things there are to do. \n\nSection 4: Visiting the Place\n\nAfter finding a house helper and learning about the area, you should visit the place. This lets you feel if the area is right for you.\n\nQuestion: Why is it important to visit the place? \nAnswer: It helps you feel if the area is right for you and your family. \n\nSection 5: Buying the House\n\nOnce you've visited the place and found a house you like, it's time to buy the house. This includes offering a price, talking about the price, and finishing the buy.\n\nQuestion: How do you buy a house? \nAnswer: 1. Make an offer 2. Talk about the price 3. Finish the buy \n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a house when you don't know the place can be hard, but by following these tips, you can find a house that is right for you and your family. Remember to learn about the area, find a good house helper, and visit the place before you decide. With careful planning and learning, you can buy a house well.\n\nGlossary\n- House helper: Someone who helps people buy and sell houses. \n- Area: A place in a town or city. \n- Things to do: Features or services that are fun or useful.\nCrime rates: How many times people do bad things in a place.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5519, "idx": 251413, "original text": "Relocation: How To Buy A Home When You Don\u2019t Know The Area\n\nJack Sanford\n\nRelocation: How To Buy A Home When You Don\u2019t Know The Area\n\nConflicted: It\u2019s the perfect description of how homeowners feel when faced with the reality of relocating from one city to another. It\u2019s both exciting and mind-numbing, frightening yet courageous and it brings up feelings of both melancholy and elation.\n\nMoving from one home to another is a life-disrupter, but moving from one town to another is a major upheaval. Watching that moving van drive down the street, fearful that it\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll see your belongings, is just one of the moments of angst you\u2019ll face when relocating.\n\nBetween then and now you\u2019ll need to find a real estate agent and a neighborhood and, finally, a home \u2013 all in a town that may be thousands of miles away.\n\nRelocating doesn\u2019t have to be a ghastly process. Let\u2019s make a plan and get you into your new town, neighborhood and home, without many of the hassles.\n\nYour Ideal Home\n\nKnowing exactly what type of home you want is the first step in your relocation process. From single-family to multi-family homes to condos and townhomes, get clear on exactly what you want.\n\nThen, decide on how much room you need \u2013 both in living space and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nAnd, don\u2019t forget the exterior. With a condo, you may not have much of a choice about outdoor areas, but if you\u2019re in the market for other home styles, determine what you require outdoors.\n\nDo you need a garage? If so, how big?\n\nIs a backyard important?\n\nDo you need outbuildings?\n\nIs a swimming pool on your wish list?\n\nIf you garden, how important is an existing irrigation system?\n\nChoosing Your New Neighborhood\n\nYour preferred home style may help narrow down your choice of neighborhoods. For instance, depending on what city you\u2019re headed to, condos may only be available downtown.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a luxury home, you may find them only in certain parts of town. If you\u2019re bringing the horses, the boat or the golf clubs and cart \u2013 all will help you choose a suitable neighborhood.\n\nIn general, however, you\u2019ll need to answer some questions to figure out where you want to live:\n\nWhat is your priority? Is it a quick commute to work, being located in a quality school district, close to public transportation or recreational amenities?\n\nDo you crave urban living or are the suburbs more to your taste? Rural living has a lot to offer as well.\n\nDo you love the sound of kids playing outside our window or does it grate on your nerves?\n\nResearch Is Your Friend\n\nIf you don\u2019t know yet how much you can afford to spend on your new home in your new city, please see a lender.\n\nWhen you have a handle on your budget you\u2019ll find the homebuying process immensely more manageable.\n\nBut, you must also take into account that the cost of living where you are now may not look at all like the cost of living in your new hometown.\n\nHow much do groceries cost in the new town? A gallon of milk in New York City, for instance, is $4.20. You can buy that same milk in Phoenix, AZ for $2.20, according to a AOL.com\u2019s Emily Rella.\n\nUtilities? One of the things that most shocks Las Vegas homebuyers is the cost of utilities. It\u2019s not at all unusual to have a $300 monthly power bill in summer from the Buffet-owned NV Energy.\n\nTo get a handle on your future costs, navigate online to a cost-of-living comparison calculator, such as this one at CNN Money or one with more detailed results at Bankrate.com.\n\nLet\u2019s Find A Neighborhood\n\nNow you have an idea of how much you can afford to pay for a mortgage every month so it\u2019s time to check out what\u2019s available in your affordability range.\n\nIf you\u2019re moving for a new job, go to a GO company map of the area surrounding your new workplace and find the neighborhoods with a tolerable commute. Then, do some research on each one.\n\nA good place to start is City-Data \u2013 the folks who hang out in the forums there have lots of good information.\n\nLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re moving to Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities and you want to live within 30 minutes of your new job, which is in Minneapolis. You\u2019ve checked out a GO company map of the area and determined that Edina, Maple Grove and Excelsior look like cool towns to explore.\n\nWith your list of must-haves in a home in hand, navigate to City-Data and click on \u201cMinnesota.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll be taken to a new page with a list of cities. Let\u2019s click on \u201cEdina.\u201d The new page is full of information about the city but, if you scroll down the page, you\u2019ll find a listing of the latest posts in the Edina forum.\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll find the nuggets of wisdom that will help you decide whether or not it\u2019s the city for you.\n\nIt\u2019s Time To Get Help\n\nThat help will come in the form of a real estate agent. If you are selling a home in your current city, ask your listing agent for a referral to an agent in your new city.\n\nIf you won\u2019t be selling, ask friends, family and colleagues for a referral to a local agent who will then help you find one in the new town.\n\nOne final tip:\n\nDon\u2019t rely on the information about homes that you find on the big real estate portal sites because much of it is unreliable.\n\nAlthough they would like you to think that they have all of the active listings in any given area, they don\u2019t.\n\nThe only accurate listing of homes available is in a region\u2019s Multiple Listing Service database, which can only be accessed by licensed real estate agents.", "hash": "da096ba0f62f56152438694ad05d28650763fa8b3a351a27b5a78be1f90bbea9"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: Fun with Building Strong Brakes\n\nIntroduction:\nToday we will talk about how people make brakes for airplanes. We will learn why it is important to choose the right materials to make these brakes strong and light.\n\nSection 1: Why Materials are Important for Airplane Brakes\n\n- Materials are the things that everything is made from. People who make airplane brakes use special materials to make sure the brakes work well and last a long time.\n\nSection 2: What Materials Are Used in Airplane Brakes\n\n- Metals like aluminum, steel, and titanium are used because they are strong and light. Aluminum does not rust, which is very good for airplane parts.\n- Some brakes also use ceramics like carbon fiber and glass to make them even stronger and lighter.\n- Composites are materials made by putting two or more materials together. They are used in airplane brakes because they are strong, light, and can handle heat.\n\nSection 3: Why These Materials are Good\n\n- The materials need to be very strong so the brakes can stop the airplane without breaking.\n- They also need to be light so the airplane does not get too heavy.\n- It is important that these materials can handle a lot of heat because brakes get very hot when they are used to stop the airplane.\n\nSection 4: Conclusion\n\nToday, we learned how choosing the right materials helps make strong and light brakes for airplanes.

{"text": "Lesson: Exploring a Special Kind of Sand\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn about a special kind of sand and how it changes when we add a tiny bit of something extra. We will look at how people find out where this tiny bit goes in the sand.\n\nSection 1: Background Information\n\nThis special sand is made of two things we find in nature. People use this sand to help turn sunlight into power and to make things that can sense stuff. One way to make this special sand is by heating it up really hot. When they make it, they sometimes add a little extra bit to make it even better.\n\nSection 2: Finding Out Where the Extra Bit Goes\n\nTo see where this tiny bit goes in the special sand, scientists use a big, special microscope. This microscope lets them see tiny parts very clearly and find out where the extra bit is.\n\nResults:\nThe tests show that the extra bit likes to stay mostly inside the sand, not on the outside. This means it joins in when the sand is being made hot.\n\nDiscussion:\nHaving this tiny extra bit in the sand can change what the sand can do. For example, it can help turn more sunlight into power or let electricity pass through better. Knowing where this tiny bit goes helps people make better sand for different uses.\n\nSection 3: What the Extra Bit Does\n\nThe tiny extra bit can do a few cool things in the sand:\n\n1. It helps the sand turn sunlight into power better.\n2. It lets electricity move through the sand better.\n3. It makes the sand stronger and tougher.\n\nConclusion:\nKnowing about the tiny extra bit in the special sand helps people use it better for different things.

This proves that the Nintendo 3DS platform continues to hold a prominent position in the Japanese video game market.\n\nAlso of note, the top 50 titles make up more than half the sales for the entire market. As I have mentioned in past financial briefings, this represents a continuing polarization of the market between titles that sell well and titles that do not.\n\nThis graph shows the Nintendo 3DS first-party software sell-through in the U.S., compared with the same period over the last two years.\n\nFire Emblem Fates was launched in America in February this year, building momentum for 3DS software sales.\n\nThe discount versions of four titles introduced under the Nintendo Selects banner in March have also provided a positive impact.\n\nWith respect to Fire Emblem Fates released in February, this graph shows a comparison between the total sell-through in the U.S. market and the total sell-through in the Japanese market, where the title launched earlier. The week of each launch is counted as Week 1.\n\nSales surpassed the 500,000 mark in the U.S. in Week 6 and have continued without losing momentum. Recently, sales caught up to Japan and are even maintaining a pace slightly higher than in the Japanese market.\n\nThis graph adds a comparison with the previous entry in the series, Fire Emblem Awakening. As you can see, there are major differences in the trends in the Japanese and American markets.\n\nIn Japan, most of the demand is filled within the first few weeks after launch, but the Fire Emblem series continues to perform well over a long period in the U.S.\n\nIn the past, the Fire Emblem series did not sell as well in the U.S. as it did in Japan. However, Fire Emblem Awakening greatly expanded the user base for the series, and the current entry, Fire Emblem Fates, has been popular abroad as well since launch.\n\nThis graph shows the Nintendo 3DS first-party software sell-through in Europe, compared with the same period over the last two years.\n\nIn Europe, Pok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon was released in February, and Nintendo Selects was kicked off last October. These titles continue to perform well, but the sales trends for first-party software as a whole remain slightly under the trends for 2014. We plan to release Fire Emblem Fates in Europe in May.\n\nTomodachi Life has been a major title that recently surpassed two million sales in Japan. In the European market, this title was localized into various languages, and was launched in June 2014.\n\nSince then, we have seen excellent long-term performance from this title, and it has gradually closed the gap over the last two years, recently surpassing the sales in Japan.\n\nThere are few titles competing in this space within the industry, and we believe that bringing out the full potential of this kind of title, which appeals to female consumers, will help our products be enjoyed by wider consumer demographics.\n\nAt the last financial briefing, we discussed the strong performance of the Nintendo Selects discount titles, which were launched in October in the European market. This sales performance has not seen much impact from seasonal variation, as these titles have continued to sell well since the start of the calendar year.\n\nThe red bar in the graph shows the total sell-through for the eight Nintendo Selects titles, while the gray bar represents the total sell-through for the same titles over the same period one year before.\nThe Nintendo Selects titles have achieved total sell-through of over 700,000 units. By changing the value prospects for the consumer, we have been able to reach a wider audience, even for titles that had seen a lull in sales.\n\nWe have also launched similar promotions in Japan and the U.S. In Japan, the title is \u201cHappy Price Selection.\u201d Compared to the sell-through for the same period in the prior year, sales have increased greatly and the ratio of female and young consumers has risen, expanding the audience for these titles.\n\nNintendo feels it is important to provide good value to our consumers without devaluing the overall price of our software. Therefore, we will not overuse these types of promotions, but we do feel these discounts can provide an excellent chance for consumers to find fresh discoveries among our rich back catalog. These promotions will be part of our efforts to maintain the popularity of the Nintendo 3DS platform in 2016 and beyond.\n\nThis slide shows the major Nintendo 3DS titles and the total units shipped worldwide. The amounts shipped over the fiscal year ended March 2016 are indicated in the red boxes.\n\nEven titles that were released quite a while ago have seen sales of around one million units this year. The Nintendo 3DS has a rich selection of evergreen titles that are popular with consumers, and we believe that the lineup offers plenty to enjoy for consumers who have purchased the hardware recently as well.", "hash": "cf18d48ce1a773ced85558265a37900f1e8cab3a7690b72985e033d95c7fca6b"}
{"text": "## Lesson: Introduction to Helping Companies Grow\n### Section 1: What is Helping Companies Grow?\nHelping companies grow is a way to give money to new and growing businesses. It is given to small businesses that want to become big but don't have enough money to do so. People give money to these businesses and get a little part of the company in return. This helps the company get bigger and the people who gave money hope to get more money back when the company becomes very big.\n\n### Section 2: How does Helping Companies Grow work?\nPeople who help companies grow give money to many businesses at the same time, hoping that at least one will do very well. They look carefully at each business before giving money, checking things like how many people might buy what the business is selling, who is running the business, and what makes the business better than others. After they give money, they also help the business do well.\n\n### Section 3: Why do businesses need help to grow?\nBusinesses need help to grow because it gives them the money and help they need to get bigger and better. Without this help, many small businesses cannot start or become big. This help also lets businesses meet more people and other businesses which can help them even more.\n\n### Section 4: Examples of Businesses That Grew With Help\nSome big businesses that got help to grow are big companies that many people know about today.

You can learn where they have gone to school, where they have worked, and other fun facts about them.\n\nSection 1: Why Learn About People?\n\nBefore you start to learn about someone, think about why you want to know more. Is it because they might be your new teacher or a new friend? Knowing what you want to find out will help you look for the right things.\n\nSection 2: How to Learn About People\n\nYou can learn about people from stories on the computer. Some stories are free, and some you need to pay for. Before you pick a story, ask a grown-up to help you choose a good one.\n\nSection 3: Looking for Information\n\nStart by learning simple things like their full name and where they live. Sometimes, you might need more details, but always ask a grown-up to help you.\n\nSection 4: Understanding What You Find\n\nWhat you find out about people can tell you about where they went to school or where they work. Always make sure what you learn is right by asking grown-ups or teachers.\n\nSection 5: Making Sure Everything is Right\n\nEven when you find things out, its good to make sure they are true.

Either they will not provide enough detail on your target or much, if not all, of the info included will be on someone (e.g., with the same name) who is NOT your target.

Does he have a criminal record? If you are about to hire a nanny, you will probably want to go a bit deeper -- Is she on any of the Sexual Offender Databases? Does she have a good driving record? If the target is being considered as your company's next CFO, you are going to want to know even more -- Is his resume' exaggerated? Has he had any bankruptcies or other serious, financial issues? Does he have a gambling problem?

We will learn how to write addresses for different places, like when someone is staying with a friend or sending something to an office. We will also learn why it's important to write where the letter came from and some mistakes we should not make.\n\nSection 1: How to Write on Envelopes and Letters\n\nTopic 1: Writing to Someone Visiting Another Person\n\nQuestion: How do you write on an envelope to someone visiting another person?\nAnswer: When writing on an envelope to someone visiting another person, use \"c/o\" which means \"care of.\" This is how you write it:\n\nAlice c/o Emma. 123 Main Street. Town, State 00000.\n\nExplanation: Here, Alice is getting the mail, but she is visiting Emma. So, we write Alice's name with \"c/o\" and Emmas address.\n\nTopic 2: Writing to Someone at Their Office\n\nQuestion: How do you write on an envelope to someone at their office?\nAnswer: When writing on an envelope to someone at their office, write the business name and the person's name and job title if you know it. Like this:\n\nMr. Jack c/o Nice Office. 123 Main Street.

{"text": "Lesson: The Rule About Sharing Secrets\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about a rule that helps keep our secrets safe and when we should not tell secrets. We will talk about how this rule helps us not tell things about ourselves that could make us feel bad. We will also look at how a group called the Electronic Helpers argues to keep this rule strong.\n\nPart 1: The Rule About Not Telling Secrets\nA big rule helps us not to have to tell things about ourselves that we don't want to. This rule says no one has to say things that could make them get in trouble or feel bad.\n\nNot Telling Secrets means if someone knows something that could make them look guilty of doing something wrong, they can choose not to tell it. This is because telling it could make them feel really bad.\n\nPart 2: Keeping Secrets Safe\nNowadays, keeping secrets safe is very important because we use computers and phones a lot. Sometimes, people who solve problems might want to look at what's in our phones or computers to find answers. They might ask someone to show what's inside their phone or computer.\n\nThe Electronic Helpers say asking someone to show what's inside their phone or computer is not okay because it's like asking them to tell a secret. They think this should not be allowed because it's like making someone tell what they are thinking, which should be private.\n\nPart 3: Stories and Examples\nTo understand better, let's imagine:\n\nStory 1: A person who might know something about a missing toy has a phone that could show where the toy is. The people looking for answers think the phone has clues but can't see them because the phone keeps it a secret. Can the police make someone unlock their phone?\n\nYes, they can. If the police think the phone has important clues, they might ask for the key to unlock it. But if the person says no because of their rights, then it's hard for the police to look inside the phone.\n\nWhat if someone has a computer with important papers about a crime? Can the police make them unlock it?\n\nYes, they can. The police might need the key to see the papers if they think they show a crime. But again, if the person uses their rights to say no, then it's hard for the police to see the papers.\n\nIn the end, people have rights that keep them safe from sharing things that might get them in trouble. As more people use codes and locks on their gadgets, this becomes a big topic. It's important to know about these rights and rules so that everyone stays fair and safe.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1530, "idx": 319714, "original text": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a brief in the case of Leon Gelfgatt, arguing that forcing the accused to decrypt a file violates the Fifth Amendment, which makes you secure against self-incrimination.\n\nOur brief argues that the lower court got it right. The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being forced to reveal the \"contents of his mind\" to the government, allowing law enforcement to learn facts it didn't already know. When it comes to compelled decryption, the Fifth Amendment clearly applies because the government would be learning new facts beyond simply the encryption key. By forcing Gelfgatt to translate the encrypted data it cannot read into a readable format, it would be learning what the unencrypted data was (and whether any data existed). Plus, the government would learn perhaps the most crucial of facts: that Gelfgatt had access to and dominion and control of files on the devices.\n\nIt's not the first time we've made this argument in court; we've filed amicus briefs in other cases involving forced decryption, and won big last year in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with us that the act of decrypting a computer is protected by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAt a time when the recent public disclosures have suggested the government has been undermining cryptography, we hope the court understands the importance of having strong technological safeguards to protect our privacy and find that our constitutional protections prohibit what the government is trying to do here.", "hash": "5c057e649e0d97e6d29cc137f012214b026058566622be6ab00a808d89057a17"}

We will look at different kinds of pieces and see them on a line with numbers.\n\n## Section 2: Fun with Pieces\nImagine you have a pizza cut into 8 pieces. You eat 2 pieces, so 6 pieces are left.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Turn Off Gas Safely When Needed\n\n## Introduction\nGas helps us cook and stay warm, but if it leaks, it can be dangerous. We will learn how to turn off gas safely when there's a problem using a special tool.\n\n## Section 1: Why turn off gas when there's a problem?\n\nTurning off gas is very important if there is a gas leak. Gas leaks can cause fires or make you feel sick with headaches or dizziness. By turning off the gas, you keep everyone safe.\n\n## Section 2: How do you know there's a gas leak?\n\nYou might smell something bad like rotten eggs if there's a gas leak. This is because gas companies put a special smell in the gas so you can notice it. If you smell this or see the gas meter moving fast, there might be a leak.\n\n## Section 3: How do you use a special tool to turn off the gas?\n\nTo use the tool, do this:\n1. Find the gas meter and the pipes at your home.\n2. Look for the gas turn-off spot near the meter.\n3. Use the tool to turn this spot until it can't move anymore. This stops the gas.\n4. Keep the tool close so you can turn the gas back on after the problem is fixed.\n\n## Section 4: What to do when using the tool?\n\nHere are some safety tips:\n1. Turn off all things that use gas.\n2. Do not light anything like candles or cigarettes.\n3. Open doors and windows to let fresh air in.\n4. Tell a grown-up to call for help to fix the gas leak.\n\n## Section 5: Conclusion\nKnowing how to turn off gas safely can keep you and your house safe. Look for signs of a gas leak and always have the special tool ready. Follow these safety tips and tell a grown-up if you think there's a gas leak.\n\n## Glossary\n- Special tool: A tool to turn off the gas when there's a problem.\n[PARAGRAPH]- Spark-resistant: A material that does not produce sparks when struck against another surface. - Zinc-plated steel: A type of steel that has a thin layer of zinc applied to it to prevent rust.\n\n## Final thoughts\nIn this lesson, we learned about the importance of shutting off gas in an emergency, how to identify a gas leak, and how to use a gas shut-off wrench safely. We also discussed safety precautions and concluded by emphasizing the importance of calling a professional to fix the issue once the emergency is over. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your safety and the safety of your family in the event of a gas leak.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 710, "idx": 429487, "original text": "Emergency Gas Shut off Wrench.

How to make a book list.\n3. How to write down book names in the list.\n4. Some examples of book lists.\n\n### What is a book list?\nA book list is a special way to keep track of books. It helps us remember which books we have read or want to read. It's like making a shopping list but for books!\n\n### How to make a book list\nTo make a book list, you need to do these steps:\n\n1. Start with a blank piece of paper.\n2. Write down important things about the books:\n   - Who wrote the book\n   - When the book was written (just the year)\n   - The name of the book\n   - Who published the book (if you know)\n   - Other things you might want to remember about the book\n\nHere's an example of what a book list might look like:\n\n```\nBook List:\n- Written by: Anna, Bob, Charlie\n- Year: 2020\n- Book Title: The Big Adventure\n- Published by: Fun Books\n```\n\n### Writing down book names in the list\nWhen you add books to your list, you write the name of the book and some details so you can remember it later. This helps when you want to tell your friends about the book or find it in the library. The key helps us find books and articles easily.\n\nHere's how to write down the details of an article using a simple way:\n\n```\nThe article by Isaac and friends (2017) talks about...\n\nwhere we write \"Isaac:2017:10.1149/2.0141801jes\" to remember this article.\n```\n\n### Examples of Writing Down Articles and Books\nHere are how we can write down details for different books and articles:\n\n```\n@article{Isaac:2017:10.1149/2.0141801jes,\n  author    = {Isaac, T and Patel, Y and Marinescu, M and Purkayastha, R and Kovacik, P and Walus, S and Swiatek, A and Offer, GJ},\n  doi       = {10.1149/2.0141801jes},\n  journal   = {Journal of the Society},\n  pages     = {A6073--A6080},\n  title     = {How batteries work and change over time},\n  url       = {},\n  volume    = {165},\n  year      = {2017}}\n}\n\n@book{Frank:2008:MANAG,\n  author    = {Frank, F},\n  title     = {Keeping Your Research Neat},\n  publisher = {Big Book Company},\n  address   = {Big City, CA},\n  edition   = {2},\n  year      = {2008}}\n}\n\n@conference{Samuel:2019:ICML,\n  author    = {Samuel, J},\n  title     = {Learning About Text},\n  booktitle = {Learning Meeting},\n  pages     = {1234--1255},\n  publisher = {Learning Books},\n  address   = {NE city, NY},\n  year      = {2019}}\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\nWe learned about a simple way to keep track of books and articles.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Simple Game\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn how to make a simple running game for a good cause. We will look at these points:\n\n1. Learning about a never-ending running game\n2. Making the game\n3. Adding ways to help animals\n4. Checking the game for problems\n5. Ways to earn money from the game\n6. Starting and sharing the game\n7. Understanding what players think and like\n\nSection 1: Learning About a Never-Ending Running Game\n\nA never-ending running game is a kind of game you can play on a phone or tablet. In this game, you help a character run without stopping. They need to jump over or move around things in their way to keep going and try to get a high score. The game does not end, and you can share your best scores with others online.\n\nThese games are fun because you can quickly start playing and feel happy when you get a high score. Some well-known never-ending running games are Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Talking Tom Cat.\n\nSection 2: Making the Game\n\nTo make our never-ending running game, we need to think about:\n\n1. Moving the character: You should be able to move the character to the left or right to avoid things.\n2. Special boosts: You should be able to get special boosts that help you, like being safe from harm for a short time or moving faster.\n3. Things in the way: The game should have different things you need to avoid, like walls, spikes, and holes.\n4. Points: You get points for avoiding things and getting boosts.\n5. New things to unlock: You can get new characters and levels if you do well.\n\nSection 3: Adding Ways to Help Animals\n\nOur game will also help animals. When you buy something in the game, some of the money will help real animals. To do this, we need to:\n\n1. Keep track of what people buy and the money given to help animals.\n2. Choose a good animal charity to help.\n3. Tell players about the charity and how they are helping.\n4. Let players give extra money to help more if they want.\n\nSection 4: Checking the Game for Problems\n\nBefore we share our never-ending running game with everyone, we need to make sure it is fun, exciting, and works well. We should:\n\n1. Let friends and family play the game and tell us what they think.\n2. Use special tools to see how people play the game and find what we need to make better.\n3. Fix any problems that stop the game from being fun.\n4. Make sure the game is not too easy or too hard to keep it fun.\n\nSection 5: Ways to Earn Money from the Game\n\nTo earn money from our game, we can let players buy things that make the game more fun but still fair. These could include:\n\n[PARAGRAPH]1. Unlocking additional characters or levels.\n2. Removing ads from the game.\n3. Purchasing virtual currency to buy power-ups.\n4. Accessing exclusive challenges or events.\n\nSection 6: Launching and Marketing the Game\n\nTo launch and market our endless runner game, we should:\n\n1. Create a visually appealing trailer that showcases the game's features and charitable aspects.\n2. Reach out to gaming blogs and influencers for coverage and reviews.\n3. Use social media to engage with potential players and share updates about the game.\n4. Offer limited-time discounts or in-game rewards to encourage players to try the game.\n\nSection 7: Analyzing User Data and Feedback\n\nAfter launching our endless runner game, we should continue to analyze user data and feedback to understand how players are interacting with the game and what improvements we can make. To do this, we should:\n\n1. Track player retention and engagement rates.\n2. Survey players about their experiences with the game.\n3. Monitor online discussions about the game and address any negative feedback.\n4. Use A/B testing to experiment with different game mechanics and features.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this lesson, we can develop a successful endless runner game that raises money for real-world animals while providing players with a fun and engaging experience. As we continue to analyze user data and feedback, we can make improvements and add new features to keep players coming back for more.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5747, "idx": 316399, "original text": "Italian developer Affinity Project talks us through its mobile endless runner that enables players to help save real-world animals\n\nThe video games industry is no stranger to charity. Countless publishers put their best brands forward for livestream events, fundraising bundles or annual promotions like SpecialEffect's One Special Day. But little to none have demonstrated this philanthropy on a daily basis.\n\nAffinity Project hopes to change this. The Italian studio is currently developing Don-Ay, a mobile title that it is positioning as the world's first donation game.\n\nDue for a Spring 2018 release, Don-Ay is an endless runner in which players guide cartoon puppies through courses littered with hazards, with a Tamagotchi-style mode allowing them to care for and customise their pet. The more they spend on the game, the more that gets raised for charity - and even users who prefer it as a free experience will be able to contribute.\n\nDiego Ricchiuti, Affinity Project\n\nA percentage of every purchase - including outfits, power-ups and in-game coins - will go to the studio's partner charity, with creative director Diego Ricchiuti underlining that: \"Each purchase represents a good deed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, ads occasionally appear at the end of each run players make. When they do, a percentage of the ad revenue will be donated to the charity. Ricchiuti adds: \"In this way, the users can donate just by playing.\"\n\nAffinity Project is unable to announce the partner charity yet, but the creative director assures us it is \"an international and very famous animal charity\", adding: \"We chose them because even though they are a huge charity, they still believe in the cause and their style is a perfect match with Don-Ay and the game community.\"\n\nThe project stems from the two shared interests of Ricchuiti, CEO Ivan Paris and MD Roberto Ressi: a love of animals, and a love of video games.\n\n\"It took time but we finally managed to fuse these two passions,\" Ricchiuti tells GamesIndustry.biz. \"For us, it is very exciting to develop games through which you can have fun and doing something good - in this case, for animals.\n\n\"While the users enjoy [the game], the Charity receives donations from the community of potentially millions of player-donators, obtaning visibility in the games market and finally solving the retention problem of the Charity - usually people donate to charities once and without getting their message or actually continue to donate.\"\n\nAffinity Project has been careful to ensure the donations are not forced - this is about encouraging genuine charitable actions among players, rather than squeezing much needed funds out of them. All in-app purchases are optional, with Ricchiuti stressing the game is \"not pay-to-win, and 100 per cent loot box free.\"\n\nBy giving its partner charity a share of ad revenue, Affinity Project enables Don-Ay players to donate just by playing\n\nSimilarly the ads are not too intrusive so as to disrupt the enjoyment of the game. There are voluntary ads that players can watch for in-game coins, objects or power-ups, while the non-voluntary ads do not appear at the end of every run. When they do appear, however, it seems they will be unskippable, in order to ensure the ad revenue donation is generated.\n\n\"This is very important because we want - and have to be sure - that players will generate a donation without spending their money,\" Ricchiuti explains. \"Players will be thanked for their patient and passive donation to the charity.\"\n\nWhile the studio is unable to share the exact percentages that will be donated to charity at this time, we're assured the donation process will be \"crystal clear\" to all involved parties: the charity itself, the studio and even the users. In fact, users will receive regular feedback on how much impact their playtime is actually having via messages from the organisation itself.\n\n\"Feedback is fundamental because it creates a sense of belonging between the users and the charity,\" says Ricchiuti. \"This feedback tells to the users how much has been donated and what was achieved thanks to their contribution. Each player can post it on their social media, letting their friends know about the charity and the good work that they are doing.\"\n\nThe hope is that Don-Ay will join the roster of mobile games that become part of users' daily routine, thus encouraging ongoing donations - even from the non-spenders. Rallying an audience around a limited time charity appeal is difficult enough, but to retain enough of an active userbase to generate significant long-term funds through the game will be Affinity Project's biggest challenge.\n\nBut the studio is confident that this unique model should garner enough interest to benefit both its own growing business and that of the organisation with which it is partnering. It is working with Italian marketing agency Noku to spread the word of Don-Ay's upcoming release, and is even reaching out to influencers in the hopes that they will get their audiences involved.\n\n\"Don-Ay is built around the idea of community and feeling part of something bigger,\" says Ricchiuti. \"While it is true that the single one-off donation may generate more money then watching an ad, by being part of the community the users learn the message and the meaning of the charity, becoming an evangelist on social media and in the games world.\n\n\"This ongoing participation to the charity world and their ongoing donation is way more useful than a one-off donation. For example, do you remember the name of the charity that you helped through one livestream fundrasing event? If the answer is no, this is a huge problem for the charity.\"\n\nSign up for The Mobile newsletter and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.", "hash": "5f3419abbcf62e05e691bdb75e1a62e7a11af3036c5d635ec203189c0c0119cb"}
{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Plastic Clips\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nPlastic clips are a kind of clip made from a stuff called plastic. They are used a lot because they have special things about them. In this lesson, we will learn about what plastic clips are like, why they are better than some other clips, and where people use them.\n\n## Section 2: Fun Examples\nLet's think about a time when plastic clips are used in cars. Car makers put plastic clips in their cars because they are light, don't rust, and don't let electricity go through them. This means they are good to use in parts of the car with electric stuff without causing any troubles.\n\n## Section 3: Real Stories\nNow, let's look at a real story where plastic clips are used in building things. People who build houses often use plastic clips because they are strong, last long, and dont get ruined by water or weather. For example, plastic clips are used a lot in outside places like decks and patios because they can handle the outside weather and stay strong for a long time.\n\n## Simple Words\n- Plastic: A made stuff that is light, strong, and doesn't let electricity go through it.\n- Clip: A thing used to join two or more things together.\n- Don't rust: Not getting rusty or old from water or air.\n- Doesn't let electricity go through: Stopping electricity from moving through something.\n\n## Ending\nIn this lesson, we learned about plastic clips, what they are like, and where they are used. We also heard stories about how plastic clips are used in building and in cars. By knowing about plastic clips, we can think of new ways to solve problems and come up with clever ideas that help us.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 550, "idx": 339125, "original text": "100x antie rack rash screws !

{"text": "Lesson: About Special Filters\n\nIntroduction:\nSpecial filters are important in making sure electricity in systems is good and stable. They stop unwanted higher sounds in electricity that can mess up the system and break things. Today, we'll learn about these filters, what kinds they are, and how they work.\n\nCore Value:\nThe big idea here is to know why these special filters are important for keeping electricity good and stable in systems.\n\nSection 1: Basic Ideas of Special Filters\n\nTopic 1: What are Special Filters?\nSpecial filters are tools that take away unwanted higher sounds in electricity. They make the power better by stopping these sounds, which can mess up the system and break things.\n\nTopic 2: Kinds of Special Filters\nThere are two kinds of special filters: quiet and active. Quiet filters use special parts to take in power and lessen these unwanted sounds. Active filters use parts like capacitors to get rid of these sounds.\n\nTopic 3: How Special Filters Work\nSpecial filters find these unwanted sounds and make a special signal that stops these sounds from causing trouble.\n\nSection 2: Active Special Filters\n\nTopic 1: What are Active Special Filters?\nActive special filters are a kind of special filter that uses parts like capacitors to stop unwanted sounds in electricity. They help make the power better and protect the system.\n\nTopic 2: How do Active Special Filters Work?\n[PARAGRAPH]Active harmonic filters work by detecting the presence of harmonics in the power system and then generating a signal that is out of phase with the harmonic current. This signal is then fed back into the system, causing the harmonic current to cancel itself out.\n\nTopic 3: Applications of Active Harmonic Filters\nActive harmonic filters are used in a wide range of applications, including industrial processes, data centers, and renewable energy systems. They are particularly useful in situations where there is a high concentration of non-linear loads, such as variable speed drives, uninterruptible power supplies, and welding machines.\n\nSection 3: Passive Harmonic Filters\n\nTopic 1: What are Passive Harmonic Filters?\nPassive harmonic filters use reactor circuits to absorb reactive power and reduce harmonics. They are designed to improve power quality by reducing harmonics, which are higher-order frequencies that can cause distortion in the waveform and lead to power losses, equipment damage, and reduced efficiency.\n\nTopic 2: How do Passive Harmonic Filters Work?\nPassive harmonic filters work by detecting the presence of harmonics in the power system and then generating a signal that is out of phase with the harmonic current. This signal is then fed back into the system, causing the harmonic current to cancel itself out.\n\nTopic 3: Applications of Passive Harmonic Filters\nPassive harmonic filters are used in a wide range of applications, including industrial processes, data centers, and renewable energy systems. They are particularly useful in situations where there is a high concentration of non-linear loads, such as variable speed drives, uninterruptible power supplies, and welding machines.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we have learned about the basic principles of harmonic filters, their types, and how they work. We have also explored the applications of both active and passive harmonic filters in a wide range of applications. By understanding the importance of harmonic filters in power quality systems, we can better appreciate their contribution to maintaining a stable voltage and frequency in an electrical system.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 902, "idx": 372185, "original text": "- Designed to meet IEEE-519. - Ultra-fast (21\u03bcs) reactive power compensation. - Load balancing between phases.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Numbers\n\n**Part 1: Simple Math**\n\nIn this part, we talk about simple math like adding, taking away, times, and sharing. These math ways help us solve problems and make choices every day.\n\n**Questions and Answers**\n\n1. What is adding?\nAdding is putting two or more things together to see how many you have in total. We use the sign \"+\" and say \"plus\". Like, 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n2. What is taking away?\nTaking away is when you have a number and you take some away to see whats left. We use the sign \"-\" and say \"minus\". Like, 5 - 2 = 3.\n\n3. What is times?\nTimes is doing adding over and over with the same number. We use the sign \"x\" and say \"times\". Like, 3 x 4 = 12.\n\n4. What is sharing?\nSharing is splitting something into equal parts. We use the sign \"/\" and say \"divides\". Like, 8 / 2 = 4.\n\n**Why We Use Simple Math**\n\nAdding, taking away, times, and sharing are important for solving math problems and making choices every day. They are also the first steps to learn harder math like algebra.\n\n**Examples in Real Life**\n\nLets say you have 10 candies and you want to buy a toy that costs 5 candies. You can use taking away to find out how many candies youll have left: 10 - 5 = 5 candies.\n\nIf you have a cake and 4 friends, you can use sharing to give each friend an equal piece of cake: 1 cake / 4 friends = 1/4 of the cake for each.\n\nIf you want to cover a floor that is 3 feet by 5 feet, you can use times to find out how much carpet you need: 3 x 5 = 15 square feet.\n\n**Talking About It**\n\n1. Why should we learn simple math?\nAnswer: Learning simple math helps us solve problems, make good choices, and understand harder math later.\n\n2. How do we use simple math in our lives?\nAnswer: We use simple math every day like figuring out how many toys we can buy, sharing food, or measuring things.\n\n**Words to Know**\n\n- Addition: Adding numbers to see how much they make together.\n- Subtraction: Taking one number away from another to see what's left.\n- Multiplication: Adding the same number over and over to find out how much it makes.\n- Division: Sharing a number into equal parts to see what each part is.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLearning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide is very important.

This test is important to check if our body is healthy and can fight off germs.\n\n## Section 1: What are Body Defenders?\nBody defenders are tiny helpers in our blood that fight germs. When doctors test our blood, they see how many defenders we have by using a special count.\n\n## Section 2: Getting Ready for the Test\nBefore you go for the test, a doctor will tell you how to get ready. Sometimes, you might need to skip breakfast. It's important to listen to the doctor so the test works right.\n\nWhen you take the test, a doctor will use a tiny needle to get a little blood from your arm. It might pinch a little bit, but it won't hurt much. Then, your blood goes to a lab where experts check how many defenders you have.\n\n## Section 3: What the Test Tells Us\nThe test results help doctors understand if your body can fight germs or if you might get sick easily. If the test says you have lots of defenders, that's good! It means your body can fight germs. If not many defenders are found, the doctor will help you get better.\n\n## Section 4: Conclusion\nKnowing about body defenders helps us take good care of our health.

This helps pay for doctor visits, medicines, and staying at the hospital. A special rule says that kids and young people can stay on their family's health care plan until they are 26 years old. This rule started in 2010 and it helps a lot of families.\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\n- Why it's good for young people to have health care.\n- What the rule about health care for young people says.\n- How this rule helps young people and their families.\n- What to do to make sure young people are covered by health care.\n\nSection 1: What is Health Care for Young People?\nHealth care is help you get from doctors when you are sick or to keep you from getting sick. In our country, there are rules that help make sure families don't have to spend too much money if someone gets sick. One rule is that kids up to 26 years old can stay on their parents' health care plan.\n\nSection 2: Important Parts of the Rule\nThe rule says that health plans must let kids stay on their parents' health care until they are 26 years old. This means even if they finish school or start working, they can still use the same health care as their family. This helps a lot because they can go to the doctor whenever they need to without worrying too much about the cost.\n\nSection 3: How the Rule Helps Families\nThis rule is very helpful for families. Before this rule, many young people lost their health care when they turned 18 or finished school. This was hard because they were just starting to work and didn't have much money. Now, they can stay on their family's health care, which helps them feel safe and looked after.\n\nSection 4: Keeping Young People Covered\nTo keep young people covered, families can:\n1. Talk to the person at work who helps with health care plans to make sure their plan follows the rule.\n2. If their plan doesn't follow the rule, they might need to get a different plan for their young people.\n3. If their plan does follow the rule, make sure to sign up again each year and add any young people who need it.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, good talking helps build trust and friendship at work.

Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present invention.\nA search for innovative, environmentally friendly and ready-to-use building composites that combine higher efficiency and quality in the building process with improved thermal resistance has been ongoing. This has set increased demands on the both thermal and mechanical (thermo-mechanical) performances of new building products integrated with various plasters, foils, particles and rubbers. The large demand on building material industry has resulted from the increasing population, leading to a chronic shortage of building materials. The engineers have then been challenged to convert the industrial wastes to useful building and construction materials. Accumulation of unmanaged wastes is one of today's significant environmental concerns, especially in developing countries. Recycling of such wastes as building materials appears to be a viable solution not only to such pollution problem but also to the problem of the economical design of buildings. The increase in the popularity of using environmentally friendly, low cost and lightweight construction materials in building industry brings the need for searching more innovative, flexible and versatile composites. The most important aspects of innovation might be in the development of integrated insulation products such as the insulated, reinforced concretes, two or three-way precast sandwich wall panels, and rubberized concretes. Part of this interest is to establish the thermal performance of the alternative systems and products. Accurate thermal characteristics are required to guide product development and manufacturing. Methods and data exist for dealing with the common building walls and insulations, but new systems and products are generally lacking such data.\nOne of the new and popular products in this sense is modified cementitious composites with scrap tire rubber. Use of rubber from scrap tires in cement concrete mixtures can result in large benefits, like lower density, increased toughness and ductility, higher impact resistance, and more efficient heat and sound insulation. The use of recycled tire rubber also helps alleviate disposal problems and address the growing public concern about the need to preserve natural sand and aggregates.\nAccumulations of discarded waste tires have been a major concern because of waste rubber is not easily biodegradable even after a long-period. Landfill treatment and unmanaged waste tires represent an environmental and health risk through fire hazard and as a breeding ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. The alternatives are thus oriented toward materials and energy recovery.\nA brick is the most basic building material for construction of low cost houses and apartments. Conventional types of brick are made from burnt clay and a significant quantity of fuel is consumed during its production.\nCrumb rubber is produced by stepwise grinding of used tires. The crumb rubber can be used in different industries such as rubberized asphalt, mats production, and play ground athletic fields. Production of crumb rubber composites will open up a new market for crumb rubber.", "hash": "b3f751fbe0c684daf86f9f14f1bdb56c0fcecfbed5fe838d543cdd0741f79eaf"}

{"text": "Lesson: Fun Pictures of Inside the Body\n\n### Section 1: Basic Ideas\nIn this lesson, we look at how doctors use special pictures to see inside our bodies and find out what's wrong. We talk about a way called CT scans, which help doctors see inside better.\n\n**Question:** What are special body pictures?\n**Answer:** These are pictures that help doctors see inside our bodies to check and help fix health problems.\n\n**Question:** What are CT scans?\n**Answer:** CT scans are special pictures that use a kind of light we can't see to show details of what's inside our bodies. They are great for seeing parts that are hard to see otherwise.\n\n**Question:** How do CT scans work?\n**Answer:** CT scans take many pictures from different sides and put them together to make a very clear picture. This lets doctors look at parts of the body from different views.\n\n### Section 2: Simple Examples\nNow we know the basics of these special pictures and CT scans, let's see how they help doctors find out what's wrong.\n\n**Case Study:** A person has a lump in their kidney. The doctor uses the pictures to see if the lump is okay or not.\n\n**Question:** Can CT scans tell if the lump is okay or not?\n**Answer:** Yes, CT scans show a lot about the lump like its size and what it's made of. This helps the doctor decide if it's harmless.\n\n**Question:** What other checks might the doctor do?\n**Answer:** The doctor might use other ways to look at the lump, like MRI or a special sound picture, and even take a tiny piece to look at under a microscope.\n\n### Section 3: Stories from Real Life\nHere, we'll find out how doctors use these pictures and CT scans to find and understand sickness.\n\n**Scenario:** A person has a bellyache, and the picture shows a big lump in their belly.\n\n**Question:** What does the doctor do next?\n**Answer:** The doctor might use more pictures, like MRI or another CT, to look more at the lump and see how it fits with other parts inside. Doctors sometimes check our bodies to help us feel better. They use special tools to look inside and see what's wrong.\n\n**Conclusion:** Today, we talked about how doctors use special tools to see inside people and help them. These tools help doctors find out what's making someone sick and how to make them feel better.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 900, "idx": 321376, "original text": "Renal cell carcinoma containing fat: demonstration with CT.\nIt is widely believed that demonstration of fat within a well-marginated renal tumor at computed tomography (CT) is highly suggestive of angiomyolipoma and can rule out renal cell carcinoma.

Let's learn about how parents can manage their time. As a parent, you need to take care of your kids and also do your work and house chores. We will see how to do all this without feeling too busy.\n\nFirst, let's understand why it's important for parents to manage their time well. Managing time helps parents take care of their kids and do other important things too. This makes parents feel less stressed and happier.\n\nOne way parents can manage their time is by deciding which tasks are most important. They can make a list of what needs to be done and decide which things should be done first. Sometimes, parents can ask other family members to help so that they can do less.\n\nAnother good idea is for parents to make a plan for each day. They can decide when it's time for meals, play, and naps. Sometimes things don't go as planned, so it's good to be flexible too.\n\nParents also need to set some rules about how much time they spend watching TV or using the computer. This helps everyone know what to expect each day.\n\nNow, let's talk about some real examples of how parents can manage their time. One important thing is making sure everyone gets enough sleep. Parents can help by having a bedtime routine and making the bedroom nice and quiet.\n\nAnother big thing is figuring out how to balance work and family time. This means making a schedule that fits both work and time with the kids.\n\nBy learning these tips, parents can take good care of their children and handle their other responsibilities too.\nParents can balance their work and home by talking about when they can work and when they can play or do family stuff. They should pick the most important tasks first and ask for help when they need it.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 780, "idx": 474592, "original text": "News Media and Climate Politics: Civic Engagement and Political Efficacy in a Climate of Reluctant Cynicism.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Being Healthy\n\nBeing healthy means not getting sick often. There are many types of sickness. One kind starts in a part of our body called the pancreas, close to our tummy. It's hard to find this sickness early, but there are ways to try and stop it from starting.\n\nIn this lesson, we will talk about how a common medicine, like the kind we take when we have a headache, might help keep us from getting this sickness.\n\nSection 1: Tiny Changes in Our Body\n- Sometimes, little parts inside us don't work right, which can make us sick.\n- A tiny change can make cells grow too fast and cause sickness.\n- A common headache medicine might help stop these tiny changes from making us sick.\n\nSection 2: Aspirin and Staying Healthy\n\nAspirin is a kind of medicine that might help keep us healthy by stopping sickness before it starts. It can slow down things in our body that make us sick.\n\nSection 3: How Aspirin Works\n\nAspirin works by keeping certain parts of our body quiet that might make us sick. It helps by calming down swelling, which can make us feel better and stay healthy.\n\nSection 4: Good Things About Aspirin\n\nAspirin is easy to find and not expensive. This means more people can use it to stay healthy, especially from sicknesses that start in places like the pancreas, which is near our stomach.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWe learned that aspirin could help stop some sicknesses from starting.

Constitutive activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a frequent molecular alteration in pancreatic carcinoma, suggesting a possible link between inflammation and cancer. The aims of the current study were to determine the effects of aspirin on pancreatic carcinoma prevention and to reveal a possible mechanism of aspirin-mediated cancer chemoprevention. An orthotopic mouse model with human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PANC-1, PANC-1/Puro, and PANC-1/IkappaBalphaM was used to study the inhibitory effects of aspirin on pancreatic tumor formation. Aspirin inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity in culture and, in turn, decreased the expression of the NF-kappaB downstream target gene, Cox-2, in PANC-1 or PANC-1/Puro cells, without significantly inhibiting the in vitro growth of PANC-1/Puro cells. All animals inoculated with either PANC-1 or PANC-1/Puro cells, and not given aspirin, developed pancreatic tumors, whereas none of the mice injected with PANC-1/IkappaBalphaM cells showed any evidence of pancreatic tumor formation. Animals given aspirin for 6 days before, or at the time of, orthotopic tumor cell injection showed a significantly lower incidence of tumor formation compared with those receiving aspirin 2 weeks after inoculation and controls receiving no aspirin. Aspirin repressed tumor formation by PANC-1 cells in vivo in a prophylactic setting, suggesting a possible mechanism for aspirin's preventive effect in pancreatic carcinoma through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and a mechanistic link between inflammation and tumorigenesis.

It can be different things like statues, big paintings, and special setups. We will learn about what public art is, the different kinds, and why it's special.\n\n**Section 1: History of Public Art**\n\nA long time ago, people made statues and big pictures to make their cities and buildings look nice. Later, during a time called the Renaissance, artists made big statues for everyone to see. Now, making art for public spaces is a popular thing to do. Artists make art that shows what the people in a place are like and what they care about.\n\n**Section 2: Types of Public Art**\n\nPublic art can be many things:\n\n1.

Public art talks about big ideas like being fair, caring for everyone no matter their color, and looking after our planet. It also makes us think in new ways and learn new things, no matter how old we are.\n\n**Section 4: Conclusion**\n\nPublic art makes our places colorful and full of stories. Artists help us see the world differently and remind us to be good to each other. Whether you like art on the streets or the more usual kind of art, there's something out there for everyone to enjoy. Next time you're outside, look around and see how art makes our places better.\n\n**Glossary:**\n\n- **Art:** Making something beautiful or interesting using skill and creativity.\n- **Community:** People who live together in one place and like similar things.\n- **Culture:** The way a group of people live, what they believe, and how they act.\n- **Statue:** A piece of art that can be looked at but not touched, and it doesn't move.\n- **Big Paintings:** Very large pictures on walls that tell a story or show something important.\n- **Installations:** Art pieces that use different parts. They can be put in one place for a short time or stay there forever.\n- **Performance art:** Live shows that can have dancing, plays, music, or other ways to show art.\n- **Landscape art:** Art that changes parts of nature to look nice and help the environment.\n\n**Why Art in Public is Good:** \n\nWhy do we have art in public places?

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Cells\n\nIntroduction:\nCells are like tiny powerhouses because they give energy to our bodies. They also help keep our bodies working right by making sure we have the right number of cells. Sometimes, cells need to stop working and be replaced by new ones, which is a natural process. But if this doesnt happen the right way, it can make us sick.\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn how a part of the cell helps in this process. We will see how this part works when cells stop working the right way.\n\nSection 1: The Cell Part and Stopping Cell Work\nThere is a special part in the cell that helps control when a cell needs to stop working. When the cell gets a signal, this part changes and helps start the process to replace the cell. This is important for keeping us healthy.\n\nSection 2: A Special Protein in Cells\nThere is a special protein in cells that helps make sure cells stop working at the right time. This protein helps two parts of the cell talk to each other so they can work together well.\n\nTurning off this protein in some cells shows that it is very important in making sure the cell replacement process works right.\n\nSection 3: Examples and Everyday Stories\nTo understand how this special cell part and protein work, we can look at examples like:\n\n1. When cells are exposed to something that changes their inner parts, it can start the process of replacing the cell. This helps us stay healthy. Some bosses will pay money to help teach new workers. They use special coupons to pay for this teaching.\n\n### Section 4: Who gives the money for teaching new workers?\nBig companies with lots of money pay this. Some schools might not pay it because their workers are paid by the town. Some towns are trying to make sure schools help pay too.\n\n### Section 5: Types of jobs for new workers\nYou can learn jobs like building, helping sick people, making things, and working with computers. Here are some jobs you can learn:\n\n1. Building Job - You get to work with wood, stones, and paint.\n2. Helping Sick People Job - You help sick people feel better.\n3. Making Things Job - You learn to make things using tools and computers.\n4. Computer Job - You learn to make and fix things on computers.\n\n### Section 6: Conclusion\nLearning jobs is great because you get to do real work and learn in a classroom. The money from big companies helps pay for this learning.

Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM), regulated by tethering proteins such as phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS2), is essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ overload by mediating ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer. In our study, we aimed to investigate the role of PACS2 in ox-LDL-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the underlying mechanisms. Ox-LDL dose- and time-dependently increased cell apoptosis concomitant with mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cytochrome c release. Silencing PACS2 significantly inhibited ox-LDL-induced cell apoptosis at 24 h in addition to the effects of ox-LDL on mitochondrial Ca2+, MMP, and ROS at 2 h. Besides, ox-LDL promoted PACS2 localization at mitochondria as well as ER-mitochondria contacts at 2 h. Not only that, ox-LDL upregulated PACS2 expression at 24 h. Furthermore, silencing PACS2 inhibited ox-LDL-induced mitochondrial localization of PACS2 and MAM formation at 24 h. Altogether, our findings suggest that PACS2 plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced EC apoptosis by regulating MAM formation and mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation, implicating that PACS2 may be a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.", "hash": "e2c52249528a9a8070dcb52306aee3239c60f5ae65e910f140bc8ddf08f27af7"}

Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to 9 Chromium - 1 Molybdenum, modified steel alloys having superior high temperature properties and weldability, methods for preparing such alloys and articles produced therefrom. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for heat treating such alloys to increase the high-temperature strength thereof and weldability of forgings fabricated therefrom and to high-pressure steam turbine rotors fabricated from such forgings.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nIn a paper published Apr. 7, 1982, authored by P. Patriarca and entitled \"Modified 9Cr1Mo Steel Technical Program and Data Package for Use in ASME Section 1 and VIII Design Analysis\", the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) presented a significant amount of technical data on their new 9 Chromium - 1 Molybdenum, modified (9Cr-1Mo, mod.) alloy. This new ORNL alloy was a modification, of existing 9Cr-1Mo alloys. These new modifications which were made to the chemical composition of 9Cr-1Mo alloys by the ORNL, resulted in a significant increase in the high-temperature properties of the alloy. The new ORNL 9Cr-1Mo, mod. steel alloy is now commercially available as an ASTM standard specification, as set forth in Table 1.\nTABLE 1 ______________________________________ Details of commercial ASTM forging specification for ORNL 9Cr--1Mo, mod. ______________________________________ Specification ASTM A-182, F91 Chemistry Element Range (wt %) ______________________________________ C 0.08-0.12 Mn 0.30-0.50 Si 0.2-0.5 P 0.02 max S 0.01 max Cr 8-9.5 Ni 0.4 max Mo 0.85-1.05 Cu 0.1 max V 0.18-0.25 Nb 0.06-0.10 N 0.03-0.07 Al 0.04 max ______________________________________ Tensile and Hardness Requirements Tensile Strength, min. ksi 85 Yield Strength, min. ksi 60 % Elongation, min. 20 Reduction of Area, min. 40 Brinell Hardness Number, max. 248 ______________________________________ Heat Treatment Normalized - 1900 to 2000.degree. F. Tempered - 1350.degree. F. minimum ______________________________________\nThe principal aim of the ORNL in developing the 9Cr-1Mo, mod. alloy described in Table 1 was to produce an alloy having significant improvement in high-temperature strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance over the prior 21/4 Cr-1Mo pressure vessel steel. The ORNL anticipated that the new 9Cr-1Mo, mod. alloy would find use in the fabrication of boiler tubes, miscellaneous boiler components and for general replacement of 21/4 Cr-1Mo pressure vessel parts.\nConventionally, rotors for high-pressure steam turbines have been fabricated from Chromium-Molybdenum-Vanadium (Cr-Mo-V) alloy forgings. Because of already known design requirements, it is highly desirable that the room temperature yield strength for such Cr-Mo-V rotors should be in the range of from about 85 to about 100 ksi. However, as is seen in Table 1, the ORNL 9Cr-1Mo, mod. alloy steel as set forth in ASTM specification A-182, F91 (Table 1), may have a yield strength of only approximately 60 ksi. Accordingly, at least on the face of it, the ORNL 9Cr-1Mo, mod. alloy steel would not be useful in connection with the fabrication of high-pressure steam turbine rotors. On the other hand, as is well known in the art to which the present invention applies, design engineers continually search for improved materials to upgrade turbine construction and in particular to increase the nominal operating life of the overall turbine installation. The present invention is a result of such search.", "hash": "54ca4c042796f95a2ddbc371d3a2b320c75004e0766e4acfecd81135e9c4c7d8"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Distance and Time\n\n**Introduction**\n\nToday, we're going to learn how to find out how far places are and how long it takes to get there. We will pretend we are driving from one town to another town.\n\n**Section 1: Finding Distance**\n\nTo find out how far two places are, we can think about how fast we go and how long we drive. We use a simple idea:\n\n**Idea:**\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\n- Distance is how far we go.\n- Speed is how fast we go.\n- Time is how long we drive.\n\nFor example, if we drive from Town A to Town B and it's 50 miles away, and our car goes 60 miles in an hour, it would take us 1 hour. So, the distance is:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour x 1 hour = 60 miles\n\nSo, Town A and Town B are 60 miles apart.\n\n**Section 2: Finding Time**\n\nTo find out how long it takes to go somewhere, we need to know how far it is and how fast we go. We use this idea:\n\n**Idea:**\n\nTravel Time = Distance / Speed\n\n- Travel Time is how long the trip takes.\n- Distance is how far we go.\n- Speed is how fast we go.\n\nIn our example, Town A to Town B is 50 miles, and if our car goes 60 miles per hour, the travel time would be:\n\nTravel Time = 50 miles / 60 miles per hour\n\nThis means it takes less than an hour to travel from Town A to Town B.\nThe travel time between two places is 1 hour.\n\n**Section 3: Practical Examples**\n\nLet's look at another example. If we want to find out how long it takes to go from NE city to LA city, here's what we need to know: The distance is about 2450 miles, and a big airplane goes 575 miles in one hour.

These tools are very important for doctors to help everyone feel better. We will learn about how these tools work and why they are important.\n\n**Section 1: How Sickness Finding Tools Started**\n\nA long time ago, people started to understand tiny parts of things that we cannot see with our eyes alone. Later, people made special tools that could find these tiny parts to help figure out what sickness someone had. \n\n**Section 2: Why Sickness Finding Tools Are Important**\n\nThese tools are very special because they help doctors see sicknesses early. When doctors know about sicknesses early, they can help people feel better faster. These tools help doctors be sure about the sickness and find the best way to treat it.\n\n**Section 3: What Sickness Finding Tools Do**\n\nThese tools can find many kinds of sicknesses. They can tell if someone has a cold, if someones body is not working right, or even if they have a very serious sickness like cancer. They also help check if the medicine is working well.\n\n**Section 4: Conclusion**\n\nSickness finding tools are very important for doctors.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Take Nice Pictures\n\n**Introduction:**\nTaking pictures is a fun way to keep memories of fun times and share them with friends and family. We will learn some simple ways to take nice pictures.\n\n**Section 1: Learning About Light in Pictures**\nLight is very important when taking pictures. It helps make your pictures look clear and bright. To take nice pictures, you need to know how to use light well.\n\n[PARAGRAPH]Shutter speed is how long the camera's shutter is open. A slow shutter speed lets in more light, while a fast one lets in less. The hole in the camera lens that lets light in is called an aperture. A big hole lets more light in, and a small hole lets less light in. ISO is how sensitive the camera is to light. A low ISO means it's not very sensitive, and a high ISO means it's very sensitive.\n\nTo take good photos, you need to balance these three things. You can use the camera's light meter to help you adjust the settings.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is exposure in photography?\n2. What are the three things that control exposure?\n3. How does ISO affect exposure?\n\nSection 2: Composition\nComposition is how you arrange things in a photo. It's about how you frame the picture and where you put things in it. There are different ways to make your photos look good.\n\nOne way is the rule of thirds, where you divide the picture into nine parts and put the main thing where the lines cross. Another way is using leading lines, which are lines that guide your eyes through the picture. Framing means using things like trees or windows to add depth to your photo.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is composition in photography?\n2. What is the rule of thirds?\n3. How can leading lines help in composition?\n\nSection 3: Lighting\nLighting is very important in photography. It can change the look of a photo a lot.\n\nNatural lighting comes from the sun or a lamp. Artificial lighting is made by things like flashes or studio lights. Soft lighting is gentle and makes things look nice, while hard lighting is strong and creates shadows.\n\nTo take good photos, you need to know how to use light well. Soft lighting makes things look soft and pretty, and hard lighting can make dramatic shadows.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is lighting in photography?\n2. How can natural lighting be used in photography?\n3. What is the difference between soft and hard lighting?\n\nConclusion:\nTaking good photos means knowing about exposure, composition, and lighting. By learning these things, you can take beautiful photos that tell a story and make people feel something. Keep practicing these ideas in your photography, and you'll take amazing pictures.\n\nGlossary:\n- Light: How bright the picture is.\n- Hole size: How big the hole in the camera is that lets light in.\n- Camera feel: How the camera reacts to light.\n- Picture setup: How things are placed in a picture.\n- Rule of three: A way to make pictures look nice by putting things in certain spots.\n- Eye path: Lines that make you look all around the picture.\n- Picture frame: Using things around to make the picture look deeper.\n- Sunlight: Light from the sun.\n- Lamp light: Light from a lamp.\n- Soft light: Light that is gentle and makes things look soft.\n- Bright light: Light that is very bright and makes shadows.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 877, "idx": 601329, "original text": "One of the reasons I am a photographer is because I love to give people the joy of being beautiful.

Earth Shakes - When the ground moves and shakes.\n2. Mountain Blow-Ups - When mountains explode and throw out rocks and smoke.\n3. Big Winds - When the wind blows very hard and brings lots of rain.\n4. Water Rises - When water comes up and covers the land.\nFloods are when too much water covers land that is usually not under water.\n\n### Topic 2: Why Natural Disasters Happen\n\nNatural disasters happen because of things like:\n\n1. The ground moving - this can make earthquakes and volcanoes happen.\n2. The weather changing - this can cause big storms and floods.\n3. The air getting warmer over time - this can make natural disasters happen more often.\n\n### Topic 3: How Natural Disasters Happen\n\nNatural disasters happen because of many things. For example, earthquakes happen when the ground moves suddenly. Volcanoes happen when hot liquid rock comes out from the ground.\n\n## Section 2: What Happens Because of Natural Disasters\n\n### Topic 1: Direct Problems\n\nNatural disasters can:\n\n1. Hurt people - people can get hurt or even die because of the disaster.\n2. Break things - houses and roads can get broken.\n3. Cost money - it can cost a lot of money because things get broken and people might not be able to go to work.\n4. Make people sick - if water or air gets dirty, people can get sick.\n\n### Topic 2: Other Problems\n\nNatural disasters can also cause problems like:\n\n1. Having to move - people might need to leave their homes.\n2. Feeling scared - people might feel scared or sad after a disaster.\n3. Trouble in communities - places where people live might have more problems like people not getting along.\n4. Hurting nature - disasters can hurt forests, make dirt go away, and make places dirty.\n\n### Topic 3: Changes After Disasters\n\nSometimes after disasters, things can get better or worse. For example, people might build stronger houses that wont break next time. But, it can also make it harder for people to have enough money or for kids to go to school.\n\n## Section 3: How to Keep Safe from Natural Disasters\n\n### Topic 1: Being Ready\n\nIts important to be ready for natural disasters by:\n\n1. Building strong houses - making sure houses can stay safe during big storms or earthquakes. We learn about natural disasters and how to stay safe. Here's how we can help and learn:\n\n### Topic 1: Getting Ready\n\n- **Watching the Weather**: We watch the sky and learn about the weather to know if a big storm is coming.\n- **Safe Plans**: We make plans to help people and animals leave safely if there is a big storm.\n- **Practice Drills**: We practice these plans to make sure we know what to do.\n\n### Topic 2: Helping Out\n\nWhen a big storm happens, we need to act fast to help:\n\n- **Giving Help**: We give food, water, and band-aids to people who need them.\n- **Fixing Things**: We help fix lights, water, and phones that the storm broke.\n- **Looking at Damage**: We look around to see what the storm broke and figure out how to help.\n- **Working Together**: We work with friends and helpers from near and far to make things better.\n\n### Topic 3: Learning and Growing\n\nStorms might happen more often, so we need to be ready:\n\n- **Being Kind to Earth**: We do things to keep the air clean and use energy from the sun and wind.\n- **Building Strong**: We make our homes and schools strong so they can stand up to big storms.\n- **Creating New Things**: We think of new ways to stay safe from storms.\n- **Teaching Everyone**: We learn and share about storms so everyone knows how to stay safe.\n\nGlossary:\n- **Earthquake**: When the ground shakes because pieces of the earth move.\n- **Volcano Eruption**: When a mountain opens and hot rock and ash come out.\n- **Hurricane**: A very big storm with lots of wind and rain.\n- **Flood**: When water covers the land that is usually not under water.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt's important to know about big storms and how to be safe.

{"text": "Lesson: About Rules\n\n### Section 1: What are Rules?\n\n**Definition:** Rules are important guidelines that help everyone know how to act. They help keep things fair and safe for everyone.\n\n**Simple Idea:** Different places have different rules. Some rules are about being nice to others, and some are about following steps written down somewhere.\n\n**Easy Example:** Imagine you see someone taking a bike that isnt theirs. You tell a grown-up, like a teacher or a police officer. They help by talking to the person who took the bike. This shows how rules help keep everyone safe and fair.\n\n**Question Time:** Do you think all places should have rules? Why?\n\n### Section 2: Kinds of Rules\n\n**Definition:** There are many kinds of rules, like play rules, school rules, and world rules.\n\n**Simple Idea:** Play rules are about sharing and taking turns. School rules help everyone learn without interruption. World rules are big rules that all countries should follow, like being kind and sharing with others.\n\n**Easy Example:** If someone breaks a school rule by not sharing, a teacher might help them learn why sharing is important. If someone breaks a world rule by being unkind to others, everyone works together to help them be nicer.\n\n**Question Time:** Should there be rules that all the world follows? Why?\n\n### Section 3: Rule Systems\n\n**Definition:** A rule system is a group of rules and ways to make sure they are followed.\n\n**Simple Idea:** Different places have different rule systems. Some places use older rules from past times, and others use rules written down in books.\n\n**Easy Example:** In our town, we use rules that everyone agrees on, like waiting your turn. In another place, like FR country, they might have rules written in big books that everyone can read.\n\n### Ending:\nToday, we talked about what rules are, different kinds of rules, and how rule systems work.

{"text": "Lesson: Using Mics in Noisy Places\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn about using mics to make sounds clearer in noisy places. We will look at three ways to use mics and talk about what's good and bad about each way. By the end of this lesson, you will know which mic to use to make your sounds clear.\n\nSection 1: What is Noise?\nFirst, let's understand noise. Noise is any sound we don't want to hear that makes it hard to hear the sounds we want. Noise can come from outside like cars, people, or machines. It can also come from inside like air cooling, computer sounds, or even noises made by a camera person.\n\nTypes of Noise:\n1. Background Noise: This noise is always there, like the sound of cars, air cooling, or computers.\n2. Foreground Noise: This noise comes and goes, like people talking or machines working.\n\nSection 2: Mic Way 1: The One-Way Mic\nThe one-way mic picks up sound from just in front of it. This is good for noisy places because it does not hear much of the other sounds around.\n\nAdvantages:\n- It hears sound from just one direction, which means less background noise.\n- It doesn't hear much of the sounds from the sides or back.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- It costs more than some other mics.\n- It can be hard to put in the right spot, especially if what you are recording is moving.\n\nExample:\nA good one-way mic is the Shure SM7B. It is used a lot in radio and for talking because it is good at not picking up background noise.\n\nSection 3: Mic Way 2: The Tight One-Way Mic\nThe tight one-way mic is like the one-way mic but picks up sound from a smaller area. This is good for noisy places where the thing you are recording is moving.\n\nAdvantages:\n- It picks up sound from a very small area, so there's less background noise.\n- It doesn't hear much of the sounds from behind.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- It costs more than some other mics.\n- It can be hard to put in the right spot, especially if what you are recording is moving.\n\nExample:\nA good tight one-way mic is the Rode NTG2. It is used a lot in movies and TV because it is good at not picking up background noise.\nLesson Title: Sounds Around Us\n\n**Objective:** To learn about microphones that pick up sounds from one way.\n\n**Introduction:** Some microphones are special because they only hear sounds from one direction, mostly the front. This is good when there is a lot of noise around because it only listens to the sound you want.\n\n**What We Learn About:**\n\n- These microphones are not very sensitive to noise that is not in front of them.\n- They are good for use when there is a lot of noise.\n- They do not cost a lot of money.\n- Sometimes, they might hear sounds from the sides or back, which is not always good.\n\n**Example:**\n\nA special microphone that only hears sounds from one way is used in places where there are a lot of other noises. It helps to hear only the important sounds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nToday, we talked about different ways microphones can be used when there is a lot of noise. Each way has good points and not-so-good points. Its important to choose the right way depending on where you are recording sounds.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 476, "idx": 33532, "original text": "Mic techniques for a bad location.

These are used to watch over machines, keep track of things, and check on the environment.\n- Other apps need people to make them work. These are apps for chatting, sending messages, and checking emails.\n\n**Why Mobile Apps are Important:**\n\n- Mobile apps help us get information and talk to people no matter where we are.\n- They help people share things quickly and work together from different places.\n- They also help businesses work better and save money.\n\n**How Mobile Apps are Made:**\n\n- Apps are made of different parts like the app itself, the servers, and the networks of phone companies.\n- A special program is put on phones to help them use certain tools. - There are big computers that keep and send the needed things for the phone's program to work. - The networks by phone companies let phones connect to these big computers.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1781, "idx": 615478, "original text": "Today, there exist hundreds of thousands of mobile data applications for mobile devices, including machine type communication (MTC) applications and non-MTC applications.

In general, a mobile data application running on a WTRU may involve interactive communications, through an operator network, with an application server (AS) located in the Internet.\nThe AS and the mobile data application may periodically exchange \u201cheartbeat\u201d messages, (also known as \u201ckeep-alive\u201d messages), to keep the application session alive and also to avoid the expiration of a network address translation (NAT) mapping, which may cause an ongoing Internet protocol (IP) session to disconnect.

{"text": "Lesson: Why Planning and Working Together is Important\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWhen we plan and work together, we can do great things. This story shows how one leader, named Gabriel, helped his team succeed by planning and working well together.\n\n**Section 1: Planning and Working Together**\n\nPlanning means thinking about what we need to do before we start doing it. Working together means everyone does their part. Both are important to finish big jobs well.\n\n**Section 2: Gabriel's Big Job**\n\nGabriel was a leader who had to plan a big, important job. He worked with his friends to make sure everyone knew what to do. They talked about their plan and practiced to get ready.\n\n**Section 3: How Gabriel and His Team Succeeded**\n\nGabriel and his team made a very good plan. They checked everything carefully and made sure everyone understood the plan. When it was time to do their job, they all worked together and did great.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPlanning and working together helped Gabriel and his team do a great job. When we think about what we need to do and work with others, we can do great things too.\n\n**Glossary**\n\n- Plan: Thinking about what you need to do before you start.\n- Work together: Everyone doing their part in a big job.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nWhat can we learn from Gabriel about working with others? How can we use planning in our daily activities?\nIn this lesson, we are going to learn about making art everyone can enjoy. We'll see how artists use easy pictures to share big ideas that both kids and grown-ups can understand. When we finish, you'll be able to make your own beautiful and meaningful art.\n\nPart 1: Easy Pictures that Mean More\n\nEasy pictures that mean more are like secret codes.

It is characterized by a feeling of have been directly called by God and by an imperative to act. Many speak of the peace that came to them with the certainty that they were working with God.\n\nQuakers recognize a variety of ministries. In our worship these include those who speak under the guidance of the Spirit, and those who receive and uphold the work of the Spirit in silence and prayer. We also recognize as ministry service on our many committee, hospitality and childcare, the care of finance and premises, and any other tasks. We value those whose ministry is not an appointed task but is in teaching, counseling, listening, prayer, enabling the service of others, or service in the meeting or in the world.\n\nThe purpose of all our ministry is to lead us and other people into closer communion with God and to enable us to carry out those tasks which the Spirit lays upon us.\n\nRecently I was at the ordination of my friend\u2019s daughter and I was struck by the authority that passed to her upon her ordination. She was given this new identity as minister and therefore the affirmation of her calling to minister to others. As a Quaker rarely is there this external affirmation from the Society where it is announced that yes you are a minister. As Jack Wilhelm Rowntree stated in 1899 \u201cWe as Friends are seeking a rich and well-tilled soil from which every type of ministry shall spring forth with a robust growth.\u201d\n\nMy calling to the service of others, my ministry, is legitimized when I act and have the experience that through my actions I am in closer communion with the Spirit.\n\nI first became aware of what a calling to communion with another meant when I did pastoral care at Messiah Lutheran in the Phillips neighborhood. When I first arrived The Lead Pastor, Pastor Lee, told me, \u201cHere at Messiah pastoral care means finding a pack of disposal diapers for a mother whose child has been in the same diaper all day, or rounding up some food from the food pantry for a hungry immigrant family that just arrived in Minneapolis, or sitting with a mentally disturbed community member who was disoriented and agitated.\u201d Giving advice and counsel wasn\u2019t in the job description, and at that time in my mind those seemed to be my best strengths. What I found was I needed to meet people where they were at, stand by them not as a professional, but as a human being. The London Yearly Meeting Quaker Faith and Practice states that Quaker ministry is giving of oneself and allowing others to give to us; our common humanity enables us to minister.\n\nIn being connected to those struggling by finding our common humanity, or what is often referred to as the God within the other, a light shone to direct me. What I received was this sense of being in communion with the Spirit, the Presence of the living God in me that saw and reacted to the Presence of the Living God in another.\n\nHow this was different from the past for me as an educator, diversity worker or counselor was when I was a professional doing professional work I wanted to do something important, change something, and be someone good. I found with this approach I could became self-righteous and arrogant, professing I knew what the truth was for others and what needed to change for a better world. In essence I did justice work, even loved kindness, but I did not walk humbly with God. When I sought to be present with the living God in another I was humbled by what happened. I felt immensely moved by the goodness in them and in standing with them blessed by their trust in me and their willingness to share their story, and I was lifted up.\n\nThis experience opened me to recognize an inward calling of ministry to the disadvantaged and poor. In ministering to a person living with tremendous loss, I found a communion with God and that knew with certainty that the presence of love can change anything and allow for miracles.\n\nLet me say for all those who might think I am saying this is a constant way I behave, you know me better than that. I know these experiences are blessings because they are intermittent, but none the less they give me a sense that I have this gift of ministry and that this Loving Presence is always with me and I can experience it if I do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with God.", "hash": "2a06a0dceea7cd9c2e43e1dacb67e8b4d4dc2ee8bc78930ac19a4a9a219dece9"}

See our disclosure page for details.\n\nOptimum Nutrition is one of the biggest names in the supplement industry and you may already know about their protein powder, Gold Standard Whey, which is probably the most popular whey on the market. They sell a variety of other products as well, including branched chain amino acids and pre-workouts but here we decided to try out their creatine capsules. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nOptimum Nutrition Creatine 2500 Caps Ingredients\n\nThe main ingredient is creatine monohydrate, specifically the kind sold by Creapure\u00ae. There are no artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors, or preservatives.\n\nThe other ingredients are magnesium stearate, which is a flow agent that helps to prevent the creatine from sticking to the machinery in the facility in which it\u2019s made, and gelatin. The gelatin forms the capsules themselves and according to Optimum Nutrition, they\u2019re made from \u201cbeef and/or pork,\u201d which may make this product off limits for some users.\n\nOptimum Nutrition Creatine Ingredients\n\nOptimum Nutrition Creatine 2500 Caps Benefits & Effectiveness\n\nThe principle ingredient here is creatine monohydrate, which is the most widely researched and studied form of creatine. It\u2019s important to note that it comes from Creapure\u00ae, a German facility that\u2019s well known for the quality and purity of their product, which is tested at the German Olympic Training Center.\n\nOptimum Nutrition\u2019s creatine is also made in a facility that\u2019s certified Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, which means the facility is subject to rules enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that may help to ensure the purity of the product.\n\nWhile this product isn\u2019t tested for banned substances by a third party group like Informed Choice, the fact that this is both Creapure and processed in a GMP facility may bring some peace of mind to folks concerned about purity.\n\nOptimum Nutrition Creatine Review\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nOptimum Nutrition has delivered, providing a high quality creatine that is likely free of impurities. While some users may find taking 4 pills to reach a 5-gram serving size, others may find the portability to be a bonus: it\u2019s easier to take a fistful of pills with you to the gym or on the road.

But if we don't take care of them, they might not work well and could break.\n\n**Section 1: Why Care for Snow Tools is Important**\n\n**Simple Ideas:** It's very important to look after your snow tools so they work well and don't break when you need them most.\n\n**Examples:** Think about a snow pusher you use to clean your driveway. If you don't keep it in good shape, it could stop working when it snows a lot, and that could make things difficult and unsafe at your home.\n\n**What It Means:** Taking care of your snow tools means cleaning them, checking them, and fixing them so they are ready to use.\n\n**Section 2: Snow Tools Care Tips**\n\n**Simple Ideas:** Here are some easy ways to take care of your snow tools:\n\n1. Clean your tools often so they don't get too dirty or rusty.\n2. Look at your tools often to see if anything looks worn out or broken.\n3. Change the oil and filters like the maker of the tool says you should.\n4. Make sure the battery works well and is charged.\n5. Keep your tools in a dry place with good air flow to stop them from getting damp.\n\n**Examples:** If you have a snow mover, clean it after you use it to get rid of snow and bits of dirt. Look at the sharp parts and other bits to see if they are okay. Change the oil and filters to make sure the engine runs smoothly. And keep your snow mover in a dry, airy place so it doesn't get wet.\n\n**What It Means:** This list helps you remember how to look after your snow tools so they work well and don't break easily.\n\n**Section 3: Talking About Taking Care of Snow Tools**\n\n**Simple Ideas:** Looking after your snow tools is a big part of having them. If you take care of them regularly, they will work better and last longer.\n\n**Examples:** Imagine you have a snow pusher for cleaning your driveway. If you don't take good care of it, it might break during a big snowstorm, making your home hard to get to and not safe.\n\n**Snow Equipment Care**\n\n**What We Learn:** Taking care of snow tools is very important. When we keep them clean and check them often, they work better and last longer. This means we don't have to fix them a lot, which saves money.\n\n**Easy Words:**\n- Rust: This is when metal turns orange and crumbly because it gets wet.\n- Melter: This is something that makes ice melt faster.\n- Wearing away: This is when something slowly gets smaller or disappears because it keeps rubbing against something else.\n\n**End Thoughts:** It's good to take care of snow tools.

Field of Invention\nThis invention relates to testing of semiconductor integrated circuits and in particular testing of parameter degradation caused by hot carrier injection.\n2. Description of Related Art\nConventional methods of testing for hot carrier effects on semiconductor transistor parameters are limited by the drain to source punch-through voltage. The effect on transistor parameters is a degradation over time, and the testing is required to assure the parameters meet a certain criteria throughout the specified life of the product. As semiconductor devices are scaled to be smaller for density and performance reasons, punch-through can be more restrictive forcing a lower stress voltage and requiring longer testing time.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,009 (Bui) is described a CMOS transistor design for optimal hot carrier testing. In this scheme is a transistor designed to have multiple common gate areas. There is an adjustment of the pad area to the gate area to minimize deleterious plasma currents. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,665 (Jiang) is disclosed a special test circuit for determining performance degradation resulting from hot carrier stress. The test circuit is formed by a string of inverters connected in series. Every other inverter in the series connection is designed to not be sensitive to hot carriers. Thus a signal transition delay is amplified by every other inverter that is sensitive to hot carrier effects on delay. In reference to \"ULSI Technology\" edited by C. Y Chang and S. M. Sze, McGraw Hill 1996, pp 657-662 is described the reliability effect of hot carrier injection. The fundamental mechanism and equations of the hot carrier effects are described.\nIn the conventional method of testing reliability of a semiconductor product for hot carrier effects, a drain to source stress voltage is applied for a period of time and parameters are measured for degradation. The time that is required by the test samples under test can be of considerable length. This time can be reduced by increasing the drain to source stress voltage. The magnitude of the stress voltage is limited by the source to drain punch-through of the transistors under test, and limits the reduction in test time for obtaining a reasonable lifetime prediction of the hot carrier effect.", "hash": "9675a2d11bc52b6cb1d6feb216eb2edcaef014cf64739e7cf3dc5da1f795d3e3"}

{"text": "Lesson: Building and Making Places Better\n\nIntroduction:\nBuilding and making places better is about changing land and old buildings into nicer and more useful places. We make new buildings, fix up old ones, and make everything more valuable. This lesson tells you how we do that, who helps do it, and why where the building is matters a lot.\n\nI. How We Build and Make Places Better\n\nA. Thinking and Checking\nFirst, we think of a fun idea for a building and check if people will like it and if we can afford to build it.\n\nB. Drawing and Planning\nNext, we draw pictures and make plans of what we want to build, like how it will look and where trees and flowers will go.\n\nC. Building\nThen, we start building. We put up walls, put in water and lights, and make sure everything needed is there.\n\nD. Finding People to Use It\nLast, we tell people about the new place so they can live there or use it for their work.\n\nII. Who Helps Build and Make Places Better\n\nPeople who help build and make places better watch over everything from the start to the end. They make sure all the plans work out and help choose the right people to build and design everything.\n\nIII. Why Where We Build Is Important\n\nWhere we build is very important. If a building is in a good place, more people will want to use it. The building will work better if it's easy to get to, near lots of people, and close to fun things to do.\n\nIV. Fun Examples\n\nA. Playing in Virtual Worlds\nOne fun way we learn to build is by using computer games where we pretend to run big machines. This helps us learn safely.\n\nB. Sharing a Cool New Tech Place\nAnother example is making a special place for new ideas and learning about technology, where people come together to think of new things and learn new skills.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nBuilding and making places better is a big job with lots of steps. By learning how it's done, who helps, and why the place is important, you can see how exciting it is to make new spaces for people.

Carbachol (10 microM) caused a 2.8-fold increase in the half-maximal concentration (EC50) for isoproterenol to stimulate ICa for adult cells compared with the control with little effect on the maximal ICa density (Imax), whereas the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on newborn ICa was completely eliminated by 10 microM of carbachol and was decreased by 40% at 0.1 microM carbachol. Carbachol increased the EC50 for forskolin to stimulate ICa 2.9-fold for adult cells and 7.3-fold for newborn cells with little effect on the Imax for either group. 5'-Guanylyl imidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p; 100 microM] reduced the stimulatory effect of 0.1 microM isoproterenol on adult ICa (percent increase over predrug level) by a factor of 1.8 compared with the control (400 microM guanosine triphosphate), whereas the isoproterenol effect on newborn ICa was completely eliminated by Gpp(NH)p. The isoproterenol effect on adult ICa persisted after the washout of isoproterenol in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Gpp(NH)p also reduced the stimulatory effect of 1 microM of forskolin by a factor of 2.0 and 8.2 for adult and newborn cells, respectively, in comparison to the control. Carbachol caused no additional effect on forskolin-stimulated ICa for either adult or newborn ICa in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin completely eliminated the inhibitory effect of carbachol on forskolin-stimulated ICa for both groups. In addition, the effect of forskolin on ICa was markedly enhanced by the pertussis toxin pretreatment in newborn cells, whereas the enhancement was relatively small for adult cells.

How many seats in a row\n3. How many seats in total\n\nSection 1: The Size of a Big Bench\n\nA big bench is a long seat where many people can sit. It is made of shiny metal and stays in one place all the time. A big bench is usually as long as a big bed and a little bit tall.\n\nSection 2: How Many Seats in a Row\n\nTo find out how many seats in a row, we check how much space each seat needs. The first row starts a little off the ground. Each seat takes up a little space. If we know how long the bench is and how much space each seat needs, we can find out how many seats fit in one row. \n\nSo, if the bench is as long as about two big steps, and each seat needs a little space, then about 1 or 2 seats fit in one row.\n\nSection 3: How Many Seats in Total\n\nTo find out the total number of seats, we multiply the seats in one row by the number of rows. If we have about 1 or 2 seats in one row and 3 rows, then we have about 3 to 6 seats in total.\n\nGlossary:\n- Seat: A place to sit\n- Total: All together\n\nConclusion:\n\nToday, we learned how to count seats on a big bench. We found out about the bench's size, how many seats in a row, and all the seats together. Knowing this helps us understand how many people can sit and watch games.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 545, "idx": 386666, "original text": "Spectator Stationary 7' 6\" Bleacher, 3 Row, Double Foot PlankRegular price $2,299.00 Sale price $2,028.00 Save $2710308DF stationary bleacher seats 15 fans on 3 rows of 7' 6\" long aluminum seat planks and double 10\" wide foot planks.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Talk About Wikis\n\n**Simple Idea**: A wiki is a special kind of website where everyone can help make it better. You can write new things or change what is already there.\n\n**How It Works**: This website uses special tools that let you add or change words. It also keeps old copies, so if something goes wrong, it can be fixed easily.\n\n**Why We Use Wikis**: Wikis are good because many people can write together at the same time. This helps everyone share what they know and work together on big projects.\n[PARAGRAPH]Knowledge Sharing: Wikis are a great way to share knowledge and information with others. By allowing anyone to edit a page, more people can contribute their knowledge and help build a comprehensive resource.\nOrganization: Wikis can be used to organize large amounts of information. For example, a company might use a wiki to keep track of all its policies and procedures.\n\nSection 4: Practical Examples\n\nLet's say you're working on a project with a group of people. You could use a wiki to keep track of everyone's progress and share ideas. Each person could create a page for their part of the project and edit it as they go along. This would allow everyone to stay up-to-date on the project's progress and make it easier to collaborate.\n\nAnother example could be a company's employee handbook. Instead of having to distribute paper copies, the company could create a wiki with all the necessary information. Employees could then access the handbook whenever they need it and easily update it as policies change.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about what a wiki is, how it works, and why it's useful. We also looked at some practical examples of how a wiki could be used. By the end of this lesson, you should have a good understanding of what a wiki is and how it can be used to share knowledge and information.\n\nGlossary\n\nWiki: A collection of articles or pages that can be edited by anyone who visits the site.\nRevision control system: A feature of wiki software that saves old versions of pages so that mistakes can be easily fixed.\nCollaboration: Working together with others to achieve a common goal.\nKnowledge sharing: The process of sharing information and knowledge with others.\nOrganization: The act of arranging and coordinating resources and activities to reach a goal.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 415, "idx": 607173, "original text": "DayZ:About.

We can use lamps, lights in the ceiling, or sunlight coming through windows to make our rooms bright.\n\n## Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question**: Why do we use lights in rooms?\n**Answer**: Lights are important in rooms because they make the room look nice, help us see better, and make the room a good place to play and work.\n\n**Question**: What kinds of lights are there?\n**Answer**: There are three kinds of lights: all-over light, work light, and show-off light. All-over light makes the whole room bright. Work light helps us see things like books or toys better. Show-off light helps make special things like pictures look extra nice.\n\n## Section 3: Learning About Lights\n\n**Learning Point**: All-over light makes the whole room bright so we can play and do things easily.\n\n**Example**: In a living room, all-over light can come from big lights on the ceiling or tall lamps that spread light all around.\n\n**Learning Point**: Work light helps us do things like reading or drawing by making that place extra bright.\n\n**Example**: Over a table in the kitchen, work lights can be lights hanging down that shine right on the table.\n\n**Learning Point**: Show-off light is used to make special things like art or a pretty vase look really nice.\n\n**Example**: In the dining room, show-off lights can be small lights on the walls or little lamps on the table that make the pictures look great.\n\n## Section 4: Simple Light Example\n\n**Simple Example**: Imagine you have a room shaped like a rectangle where you want to hang a light from the middle of the ceiling. You need to decide how high to hang it so it lights up the room nicely but isn't too low.\n\na = 5 feet (half of the width)\nb = 5 feet (half of the length)\nc = 8.66 feet\n\nSo, the light should be hung 8.66 feet up from the ground to light up the whole room nicely.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 866, "idx": 402765, "original text": "Classic spot.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Simple Data Files\n\nIntroduction:\nData files that use commas to separate things are common. They are simple text files that have information in rows and columns. For example, look at this simple data file:\n\n```\nname, age, job\nAdam, 35, Worker\nBella, 28, Artist\n```\n\nHere, each line is about one person. Their name, age, and job are separated by commas.\n\nSection 1: Simple Data Files\n\nThese are plain text files that show data in rows and columns. Every line is a new row and commas break up the columns.\n\nSection 2: Reading Data Files Simply\n\nTo read these files, we can use a simple command in Bash. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Load the file into a list\nreadarray -t lines < mydatafile.csv\n\n# Go through the lines and show them\nfor line in \"${lines[@]}\"; do\n    echo \"$line\"\ndone\n```\n\nIn this example, we load the lines of the data file into a list called `lines`. Then, we go through each line and show it.\n\nSection 3: Working With Data Files\n\nAfter loading the data file into a list, we can use the data in different ways. Here are some examples:\n\n1.

We will also learn how thinking carefully helps us solve mysteries about old places.\n\n**Section 1: Introduction**\n\nA long time ago, there was a big, beautiful garden called the Big Garden. It was in a place that we now call IR city. This garden was famous because it was very pretty with lots of plants and flowers. It was built by a king to show how rich and smart he was. Even though the garden is gone now, it is still one of the most famous gardens ever.\n\n**Section 2: Significance**\n\nThe Big Garden was important because it showed the king was very rich and good at building things. It also mixed ideas from different places together. Today, we remember the Big Garden because it shows us that people can make beautiful things.\n\n**Section 3: Location**\n\nFor a very long time, people did not know where the Big Garden really was. But after a lot of searching and thinking, some smart people think they found it near a place called Nineveh. They figured this out by reading old stories and using new tools.\n\n**Section 4: Thinking and Solving Problems**\n\nTo find out where the Big Garden was, people had to think really hard and be very careful. They looked at clues, thought about different ideas, and figured out the best answer. This is how we solve problems, not just in finding old gardens, but in many things we do.\n\n**Glossary:**\n\n- Big Garden: A famous garden built a long time ago in what is now IR city.\n- Old Wonders: A list of seven amazing things made a long time ago.\n- People who study old things: Scientists who look at old stuff to learn about people from the past.\n- Thinking carefully: Looking at information and thinking about it to understand it better.\n- Solving problems: Figuring out answers to tricky questions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Big Garden shows us how amazing things were made a long time ago and how beautiful nature can be.

{"text": "Lesson: Why We Write Things Down\n\nIntroduction:\nWriting things down is a big part of our day. It means we keep information about things that happen, like what we buy or fun events.

This lesson will show us why writing things down is good and how it helps us in many ways.\n\nSection 1: Why Writing Things Down is Good\n\nTopic 1: Personal Benefits\nWriting helps us remember fun times, think about what happened, and see how we are doing with our goals. When we write our thoughts and feelings, we understand ourselves better. Writing down what we do every day helps us stay neat and do more things well.\n\nTopic 2: Legal and Money Benefits\nWriting is very important when dealing with money or the law. For example, writing down what we spend helps us see where we can save money. If we ever need to solve a problem with someone else, having written proof is very useful.\n\nTopic 3: History and Culture Benefits\nWriting helps keep history and culture alive. By writing down stories and customs from long ago, we learn and understand more about the world. Writing also saves languages and cultures that are not seen much anymore, so they are not forgotten.\n\nSection 2: How to Write Things Down Well\n\nTopic 1: Choosing the Right Method\nThere are many ways to write things down, like drawing, taking photos, or making videos. What you choose depends on what you like and what you want to write about. If you want to share your thoughts, writing might be best. If you want to show what something looks like, photos or videos might work better.\n\nTopic 2: Keeping Your Writings Organized\nAfter you pick how to write, you need to keep your writings in order. You can use folders or tags to help. Make sure to keep your writings safe and make copies so you don't lose them.\n\nTopic 3: Sharing Your Writings\nMake sure other people who might need your writings can see them. If you are writing about history, keep it where people who study history can look at it. Also, write clearly so everyone can understand what you are sharing.\n\nSection 3: Examples of Good Writing\n\nTopic 1: Personal Diaries\nA diary is a good way to write about your feelings and what happens each day. It helps you understand more about yourself and how you react to different things. [PARAGRAPH]Additionally, diaries can help you to track your progress towards personal goals and identify areas where you need to improve.\n\nTopic 2: Legal Documents\nLegal documents, such as contracts and wills, are essential for protecting your rights and assets. By having these documents properly drafted and executed, you can avoid legal disputes and ensure that your wishes are carried out after your death.\n\nTopic 3: Cultural Archives\nCultural archives are essential for preserving the history and traditions of different communities.

This music talks about cities, machines, and sometimes about rules and leaders. We will learn about loud music, where it came from, what it sounds like, and some important music makers.\n\nSection 1: History of Loud Music\n\nLoud music began a long time ago in a place called England. It was different from other music because it didn't sound pretty or nice. The people who made loud music used sounds from machines and other noisy things. They tried new ways to make music to make something special.\n\nSection 2: What Loud Music Sounds Like\n\nLoud music can sound rough and sharp. It repeats sounds a lot and can make you feel a bit uncomfortable. It uses machine-like beats and electronic noises. Many loud music songs are slow and use the same short music piece over and over.\n\nSection 3: Important Music Makers\n\nMany people helped make loud music popular. Some of the most famous are the bands called Big Throb, Fancy Hats, and Falling Bricks. They helped make loud music the way it is.\n\nSection 4: Examples of Loud Music\n\nTo understand loud music better, let's think about some songs. Here are two examples:\n\n1. \"Happy Tune\" by Tall Puppy\n2. \"Go Right\" by Office\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nLoud music is a special type of music that has changed other kinds of music too.

Costanza\n| February 23, 2010\n\nAlready one of the nation\u2019s premiere drug retailers, with more than 7,100 stores spanning all 50 states, Walgreen (WAG) has decided to take a bite out of the big apple. Indeed, the company recently announced that it would buy New York-based Duane Reade and its 257 stores for just shy of $1.1 billion, including the assumption of $457 million in debt. The deal is expected to close by August 31, 2010, Walgreen\u2019s fiscal year end.\n\nAlthough the Walgreen story, by historical measures, has been one of organic growth, it has more recently broadened its strategic arsenal and embraced acquisitions as a means of increasing its customer base and expanding its reach into new niches and areas. The most recent purchase of Duane Reade exemplifies the evolution of the management team and its strategy, and lays credence to our view that Walgreen will be at the forefront of this industry for decades to come. Indeed, the announcement is a clear signal to the competition, specifically CVS Caremark (CVS), which, following its industry changing marriage in late 2007, has been slowly making its way to the New York City area, that Walgreen will not be bullied and is up to the task of competing on the grandest stage.\n\nPrivately held Duane Reade operates almost exclusively in the tri-state area, with a particular stronghold in the New York metropolitan area. It has stores on just about every corner of what just so happens to be the most lucrative market in the U.S. Its customers tend to be very loyal, enabling the chain to produce some pretty impressive metrics according to industry standards. (Its sales per square foot are tops in the retail drug industry.) For this reason, Walgreen plans on maintaining the Duane Reade moniker for now.\n\nEither way, the deal is a major boon for Walgreen, giving it fairly quick and relatively inexpensive access to the Empire State, an area into which pricey real estate has kept it from making significant inroads. Although management says that the merger will be dilutive to earnings in the first year after closing (prompting us to slightly trim our fiscal 2010 earnings estimate), it ought to be a major contributor for years after, providing annual cost savings in the neighborhood of $125 million after all the kinks are worked out. Walgreen is, along with CVS, the gold standard in the drug retail space. Its stores are brightly lit and inviting. Aisles are wide and clutter-free, with shelves that are fully stocked and in order. Duane Read locations, on the other hand, if you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to shop at one, tend to be home to a less shopper-friendly ambiance. Stores are generally dark, poorly stocked, and cluttered, making for a far less enjoyable shopping experience, in our opinion. Even Duane Reade appears to have recognized the problem with newer stores appearing to address the issues. However, there is still room for much improvement and Walgreen should benefit from putting a few finishing touches on the newest stores in its collection.\n\nThe drug retail space remains one of much interest. An aging population, ongoing medical advances, and a growing need for prescription drugs paints a favorable backdrop for most here, but especially industry leaders, such as Walgreen. Although we\u2019ve tempered our near-term outlook to account for the trials and tribulations that will likely be associated with the aforementioned merger, we look for Walgreen to post solid earnings growth this year, with further improvement in 2011.\n\nWall Street showed little interest in the Duane Reade deal, and we think that was a mistake. We believe liquidity concerns are overblown and expect the endeavor to pay off in spades out to 2013-2015. That said, we would not be surprised to see further industry consolidation. Rumors are circulating that Rite Aid (RAD) may be on the block with CVS and even retail behemoth Wal-Mart (WMT), which has thrown its hat in the prescription-drug ring, mentioned as potential suitors.", "hash": "153361bba523e19fa849d859ba7a35c0739be86d533febfe0081288f6a5a29d3"}

These changes can be translated into decrements in neuronal functioning accompanied by behavioral declines, such as decreases in motor and cognitive performance, in both humans and animals. When coupled with genetic alterations, the ultimate expression of these changes is seen in diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). This association will be discussed in the last section of this chapter. In this review we will describe motor and cognitive deficits in behavior due to aging, and show how these deficits are related to increased vulnerability to oxidative stress, inflammation or signaling. Importantly, using muscarinic receptors as examples, we will also try to show that the sensitivity to these insults may be differentially expressed among neurotransmitter receptor subtypes.", "hash": "4012caf48cbdd2d44c61c7d1f52812bcc6da38cb216eb043328b2f92b2c1cd80"}

If we mess up nature or make the air and water dirty, it can hurt animals and plants. We need to save nature so kids in the future can have a good place to live and play. Taking care of nature also helps slow down the earth getting too warm.\n### How Can We Help Our Planet?\nWe can help by riding buses, bikes, or walking more instead of cars. We can turn off lights when we don't need them and use less water. We can also recycle things like paper and bottles instead of throwing them away. Choosing to buy things from places that care about keeping the earth safe is another good idea. We can also teach our friends and family why it's important to take care of our planet.\n### Practical Examples\nA good way to help is by planting trees. Trees breathe in bad air and breathe out clean air, which helps stop the earth from getting too warm. Using less plastic is also important because it can hurt sea animals.

This rule changed some important laws about medicines to make sure that new and helpful medicines are protected and that cheaper medicines can be sold sooner.\n\n**Section 1: What is Medicine Protection?**\n\nMedicine protection is a special time when the company that made the medicine can sell it alone. During this time, no other company can sell the same medicine. This helps the company that made the medicine because they spent time and money to create it.\n\n**Section 2: What the New Rule Does**\n\nThe new rule made some changes to the old laws to help understand medicine protection better. It makes sure that only really new and different medicines get special protection. The rule helps by:\n1. Asking for advice on what makes a medicine \"new.\"\n2. Checking if a medicine really should have special protection.\n3. Making sure all information given is true and complete.\n\n**Section 3: What These Changes Mean**\n\nThe changes mean that there will be a careful check to make sure that the special protection is given only to really new medicines. This can make it harder for companies to keep their special protection but also helps cheaper medicines come to the market faster.\n\n**Glossary**\n\n- Medicine protection: A special time when only the company that made the medicine can sell it.\n- Special protection extension: Adding more time to protect a medicine if there are delays.\n- Important medicine law: The law that tells how medicines should be handled and sold.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe new rule changed the old laws to make sure that new and helpful medicines are well protected and that cheaper medicines can come to the market sooner.

{"text": "Lesson: Staying Safe from a Bad Gas\n\n## Introduction\nA bad gas you can't see can make you very sick or even worse if you don't find it early. It comes from burning things like gas, oil, and wood. This bad gas takes away the air we need to breathe. We will learn about the dangers of this bad gas, how to stop it from making us sick, and what to do if it's around.\n\n## Section 1: Understanding the Bad Gas\n\n### Topic 1: What is the Bad Gas?\nThe bad gas is made when things don't burn all the way. It has no color, smell, or taste and is very dangerous. It can come from cars, trucks, and things used to keep us warm or cook food.\n\n### Topic 2: Signs of the Bad Gas\nThe signs of this bad gas can look like other sicknesses. You might get a headache, feel dizzy or weak, feel sick to your stomach, get confused, or have a sore chest. If there's a lot of it, you might pass out or worse.\n\n### Topic 3: Where Does the Bad Gas Come From?\nThe bad gas can come from anything that burns fuel, like stoves, cars, and heaters. It can be inside homes from things like fireplaces or heaters or outside from cars and machines.\n\n### Topic 4: How to Stop the Bad Gas\nTo keep the bad gas away, do these things:\n- Put detectors in your home to tell you if there's bad gas.\n- Check heaters and chimneys every year.\n- Never use things meant for outside inside your home.\n- Let fresh air in when using fireplaces.\n- Never leave a car running in a closed space.\n\n### Topic 5: What to Do if There's Bad Gas\nIf you think there's bad gas, do this:\n- Open doors and windows to let in fresh air.\n- Turn off everything that could make the bad gas.\n- Go outside right away.\n- Call for help from outside your home.\n- Stay out until it's safe to go back in.\n\n## Section 2: Preventing the Bad Gas\n\n### Topic 1: Why It's Important to Check Things\nChecking heaters and chimneys can stop the bad gas from forming. A check-up can find problems like cracks, blocks, and other dangers.\n\n### Topic 2: Types of Heating Things\nHomes have heaters and stoves that keep us warm. They need to be checked often to make sure they are safe and work right.\n\n### Topic 3: Keeping Chimneys Safe\nIt's good to look at and clean chimneys a lot so they don't get dirty inside. This stops fires and keeps the air clean in your house.\n\n### Topic 4: Being Safe with Wood Stoves\nWood stoves make a lot of smoke and need to be put in right and looked after to keep everyone safe. Always use dry wood and keep the door closed.\n\n## Section 3: Stories from Real Life\n\n### Topic 1: Being Careful with Generators\nGenerators make a lot of smoke and should only be used outside. A story tells about a man who got very sick because he used a generator inside his house.\n\n### Topic 2: Why Smoke Alarms Are Important\nA family was saved because they had smoke alarms that told them there was danger from their heater.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKeeping safe from smoke is very important. You can stay safe by checking your heaters, putting in smoke alarms, and never using things like generators inside your house.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 556, "idx": 294422, "original text": "Each year, more than 150 people die from unintentional non-fire related carbon monoxide poisoning associated with consumer products.

{"text": "Lesson: Big Sales When You Buy More\n\nLet's learn:\nWhen you buy a lot of something, you can pay less for each one. This is called a \"big sale for buying more.\"\n\nPart 1: Learning About Big Sales\n\n1. What is a big sale for buying more?\nIt is when a store lets you pay less if you buy a lot of something.\n\n2. Why do stores do this?\nStores want you to buy more so they can sell more things.\n\n3. How does this make things cheaper?\nWhen you buy more, the store makes each thing cost a little less.\n\nPart 2: Trying It Out\n\n1. Imagine a store has a special: If you buy more than 100 toys, each toy is 10% cheaper. If you buy 120 toys, how much do you pay?\nFirst, you find out how much cheaper each toy is (10% less means each toy is $0.90). Then, you add up the cost of 100 toys and the 20 cheaper toys.\nTotal cost = (100 toys x $1) + (20 toys x $0.90) = $100 + $18 = $118\n\n2. What if you buy 500 toys with each toy 5% cheaper?\nFirst, find how much cheaper each toy is (5% less means each toy is $0.95). Then, add up the cost of 100 toys and the 400 cheaper toys.\nTotal cost = (100 toys x $1) + (400 toys x $0.95) = $100 + $380 = $480\n\nPart 3: Thinking About It\n\n1. Why do stores give these big sales?\nStores give these big sales so you can buy more and they can sell more.\n\n2. What happens to the stores money when they give a big sale?\nIf the sale is just right, the store can still make money even after making things cheaper.\n\nWhat we learned:\nWe learned how big sales work and tried some examples. Knowing about big sales helps us when we buy a lot of something.\n[PARAGRAPH]Real estate investment is the process of buying, holding, and selling property with the aim of generating income or capital gains. It is a popular way to build wealth and achieve financial freedom. In this lesson, we will explore the basics of real estate investment and how it works. \nSection 1: Understanding Real Estate Investment \nTopic 1: Types of Real Estate Investments \nThere are four main types of real estate investments: residential, commercial, industrial, and land. Residential properties include single-family homes, condos, townhouses, and apartments. Commercial properties include office buildings, retail spaces, and warehouses. Industrial properties include factories, storage facilities, and other industrial buildings. Land can be undeveloped or developed, and it can be used for farming, ranching, or other purposes. \nTopic 2: How Real Estate Investment Works \nReal estate investment works by purchasing a property at a lower price than its market value and then selling it for a profit. This can be done through various strategies such as fixing and flipping, buy-and-hold, and wholesaling. The key to success in real estate investment is finding undervalued properties, adding value through renovations or other means, and selling them for a higher price. \nSection 2: Evaluating Real Estate Investment Opportunities \nTopic 3: Market Analysis \nBefore investing in real estate, it is essential to conduct a thorough market analysis. This involves researching the local economy, population growth, employment rates, and other factors that affect property values. It also includes analyzing the supply and demand of properties in the area, as well as the average sale prices and rental rates. \nTopic 4: Property Evaluation \nOnce the market analysis is complete, it is time to evaluate the property itself. This involves assessing its physical condition, location, and potential for appreciation or rental income. It is also important to consider the property's current market value and the potential for future growth. \nSection 3: Building Wealth Through Real Estate Investment \nTopic 5: Strategies for Building Wealth \nThere are several strategies for building wealth through real estate investment, including: \n- Fix and Flip: Purchasing a property below market value, renovating it, and selling it for a profit. \n- Buy-and-Hold: Purchasing a property to rent out for steady income. \n- Wholesaling: Assigning a contract to buy a property to another investor for a fee. \n- Lease Options: Renting a property with the option to buy it later at a predetermined price. \nConclusion: \nReal estate investment can be a lucrative way to build wealth. By understanding the different types of investments, conducting thorough market and property evaluations, and implementing effective strategies, investors can achieve their financial goals. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced investor, there is always something new to learn about real estate investment.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 739, "idx": 270132, "original text": "New$2.64 + GST.

{"text": "Lesson: Sharing Things for a While\n\nSometimes, people or companies don't have enough money to buy big or expensive things they need. So, they can decide to share these things for a while by paying a little bit of money regularly. This is called sharing things for a while, and it helps them use what they need without paying all the money at once.\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about sharing things for a while, why it's helpful, and when people choose to do it.\n\n**Section 1: Sharing Things for a While**\n\nSharing things for a while means some people or companies can use big or expensive items without having to buy them right away. They pay a little bit of money often, maybe for a few years. This is really helpful for new companies or small businesses that don't have enough money to buy everything they need.\n\n**Section 2: How It Works**\n\nWhen a company decides to share something for a while, they make a deal to use the item and pay for it slowly. They give money to the owner of the item regularly to cover the cost and maybe a little extra. When the time of sharing ends, they can choose to buy the item, give it back, or keep sharing it for more time.\n\n**Section 3: Good Things About Sharing Things for a While**\n\nSharing things for a while is good because:\n\n- It doesn't need a lot of money at once: Companies can use their money for other important things while still getting what they need.\n- It's flexible: The deal can be made to fit what the company needs, for a short or long time.\n- It might help save on taxes: Sometimes, the money paid can be counted in a way that saves on taxes.\n- It makes it easier to get things: Companies can use items that might be too expensive to buy all at once.\n\n**Section 4: When People Share Things for a While**\n\nPeople share things for a while in many situations, like:\n\n- When they need big machines for building things\n- When hospitals need new medical tools\n- When a company needs many cars or trucks\n\n**Section 5: Important Words to Know**\n\nSome words we use when talking about sharing things for a while are:\n\n- End value: This is what we think the item will be worth when the sharing time is over.\n- Sharing cost percentage: This is how much extra money you pay for using the item over time.\n- Getting Smaller: When things we use get old, they aren't worth as much as before.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 917, "idx": 112476, "original text": "1-800-558-7337.

{"text": "**Section 6: Simple Stories**\n\nLet's think about a store that wants to get a big tool that costs a lot of toy money. Instead of paying all the toy money right away, they choose to pay a little bit each month for five years. They agree to pay toy money every month and a bit extra because they're paying over time.\n\nAfter five years, the store will have paid much more toy money than the tool costs at first. Part of this extra toy money is because they took time to pay.\n\nWhen the five years are up, the store can choose to keep the tool by paying just a little bit of toy money, or they can give it back.\n\n**Section 7: Talking About It**\n\n1. Why might paying over time be better than paying all at once for a big tool?\n2. When would a store want to pay over time for something?\n3. How does getting smaller in value change how much something costs over time?\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Value later: How much something is worth after some time.\n- Extra cost rate: How much more toy money you pay because you're taking time to pay.\n- Getting smaller: When things we use get old, they aren't worth as much as before.\n\n**The End Bit**\n\nPaying over time is a good way for stores to get big tools without needing lots of toy money right away.

Furthermore, by way of example, an LCL-filter can be connected to each phase connection of the converter unit. FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a device for carrying out a method for operating a converter circuit according to the prior art. The converter circuit in FIG. 1 has a converter unit 1. The converter unit 1 shown in FIG. 1 is connected to an energy storage circuit 2 which is formed in the conventional manner by two series-connected capacitors. In order to operate the converter circuit, a device is provided which has a control device 15 for producing a hysteresis signal vector x, which device 15 is connected to the controllable power semiconductor switches in the converter unit 1 via a control circuit 3 for forming a control signal S from the hysteresis signal vector x. The power semiconductor switches are therefore controlled by means of a control signal S. The hysteresis signal vector x is formed by means of a hysteresis regulator 6 from a difference-phase connection current vector \u0394ifi,i. The difference-phase connection current vector \u0394ifi,i is in turn formed from subtraction of a phase connection current vector ifi,i from a reference phase connection current vector ifi,i,ref, with the reference phase connection current vector ifi,i,ref being formed from a reference power value Pdiff, a reference wattless-component value Qdiff and a phase flux vector \u03c8g,\u03b1\u03b2.\nThe method for operating a converter circuit described above is subject to the problem that the switching frequency of the power semiconductor switches varies to a very major extent as a result of the formation of the reference phase connection current ifi,i,ref from the reference power value Pref, from the reference wattless component value Qref and from the phase flux vector \u03c8g,\u03b1\u03b2. A switching frequency which is variable to such a major extent results in a significant increase in the harmonics in the phase connection currents ifg,i and in the phase connection voltages uinv,i on the converter circuit. In this context, FIG. 4 shows a corresponding time profile of a phase connection current ifg,1 which is subject to major harmonics, for one phase. By way of example, when the converter circuit is connected to an electrical interconnected power supply system, such high harmonic components are undesirable or are unacceptable. For example, when the converter circuit is connected to an electrical load, harmonics such as these can lead to damage or even destruction, and are therefore very highly undesirable.", "hash": "fdcb071462ac2c4a6eaac1c844e3b4455d57a3461cf7de0669410d7244dd5043"}
{"text": "Lesson: About Our Body's Nerve System\n\n### Section 1: What is Our Nerve System?\nOur nerve system helps us feel, think, and move. It is made up of our brain, the long string in our back (spinal cord), and tiny threads (nerves) all over our body.\n\n### Section 2: The Nerve System\nThe nerve system has tiny parts called nerve cells. They send messages all around our body to help us do things like walking, talking, and eating.\n\n### Section 3: Message Senders\nMessage senders in our body help nerve cells talk to each other. They send tiny signals that help us do things like moving our hands or remembering our friends name.\n\n### Section 4: Learning and Changing\nOur brain can learn new things and change when we learn. It can make new links or make the old links stronger or weaker. This helps us get better at things we practice.\n\n### Section 5: Sending Messages\nSending messages is how nerve cells in our brain talk to each other. They send tiny parts called message senders across tiny gaps to reach other nerve cells.\n\n### Section 6: Making New Nerve Cells\nOur brain can make new nerve cells, too. This mostly happens when we are little kids, but some parts of our brain keep making new cells even when we grow up.\n\n### Section 7: Nerve Cell Networks\nNerve cell networks are groups of nerve cells that work together to help us see, move, and think. They are very important for everything we do.\n\n### Section 8: When Nerve Cells Get Sick\nSometimes, nerve cells can get sick, and this can make it hard for people to think or move. There are doctors who work very hard to help people with sick nerve cells feel better.\n\n### Glossary\n- Nerve Cell: A tiny part in our body that sends messages\n- Message Sender: Tiny parts that help nerve cells talk to each other\n- Learning and Changing: How our brain gets better at things when we learn\n- Sending Messages: How nerve cells send information to each other\n- Making New Nerve Cells: How our brain can make new nerve cells\n- Nerve Cell Networks: Groups of nerve cells that work together\n- When Nerve Cells Get Sick: What happens when nerve cells do not work right\n\n### Conclusion\nLearning about our nerve system is fun!

{"text": "## Lesson 1: Introduction to Pathology and Disease\n### Section 1: Overview of Pathology and Disease\nPathology is the study of diseases and their causes, mechanisms, and development. It is a branch of medicine that deals with the laboratory examination of tissues, fluids, and organs to diagnose and study disease. Disease refers to any abnormal condition of the body or mind that affects the normal functioning of an organism.\n### Section 2: Types of Diseases\nThere are four main types of diseases: infectious, non-infectious, genetic, and environmental. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Non-infectious diseases are caused by factors such as lifestyle choices, genetics, and aging. Genetic diseases are caused by mutations in genes that lead to abnormal functioning of the body. Environmental diseases are caused by exposure to toxins or other harmful substances in the environment.\n### Section 3: The Role of Pathologists\nPathologists are medical doctors who specialize in the study of diseases. They use various techniques such as microscopy, biochemical tests, and molecular biology to examine tissues, fluids, and organs to diagnose and study diseases. Pathologists play a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.\n### Section 4: The Importance of Pathology and Disease\nPathology and disease are important fields of study because they help us understand the causes and mechanisms of diseases and develop treatments and preventive measures. By studying pathology, we can learn about the different types of diseases, their symptoms, and their effects on the body. This knowledge can help us make informed decisions about our health and the health of others.\n### Conclusion\nIn this lesson, we learned about the basics of pathology and disease, including their definitions, types, and the role of pathologists.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate alternative management strategies, such as the use of attractants for monitoring and controlling psocids, which can be incorporated into integrated pest management programs for psocids. Using a two-choice pitfall test, we studied the response of adults of different ages and sexes of Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae), Liposcelis paeta Pearman, Liposcelis decolor (Pearman), Liposcelis brunnea Motschulsky, Liposcelis corrodens (Heymons), and Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein (Psocoptera: Trogiidae) to volatiles from different potential attractants including grains, grain-based oils, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, and commercially available kairomone lures. For all species tested, sex and age did not have a major influence on response to the different potential attractants. Brewer's yeast most consistently elicited the strongest response for psocids, but this response frequently was not different from that to wheat germ and wheat germ oil. The percentage response to brewer's yeast varied among the psocid species tested: L. decolor (73-78%), L. entomophila (62-73%), L. brunnea (64-68%), L. paeta (42-57%), Lep. reticulatus (40%), and L. corrodens (15-19%). Two psocids species (L. corrodens and Lep. reticulatus) had low responses to all the potential attractants evaluated compared with the other four species.

It helps decide who gets what, who makes the rules, and who makes sure everyone follows the rules. Today, we will learn about how people make rules and lead. There are different ways people lead in different places. Some places let everyone decide together, and some places have one leader or a family that decides everything.\n\nFirst, we talk about different ways to lead. Some places, like a playground with rules that everyone agrees on, let everyone decide. But in other places, one person or a small group decides all the rules, like a game where one friend makes all the rules.\n\nNext, we see how these different ways can make things different for everyone. In places where everyone decides, people can say what they think and help make the rules. This is nice because everyone gets to play a part.

{"text": "Lesson: All About Watering Plants\n\n## Chapter 1: About Watering Plants\n\nWatering plants is very important for farms because it helps plants drink water. Most farms use a rain-like system to water plants. Today, we will learn how this rain-like system works and why it's good for plants.\n\n## How Sprinkler Systems Help Plants Grow\n\nSprinkler systems are like big watering cans that help water plants in the garden. They have pipes that carry water to little sprinklers. The sprinklers spray water onto the plants so all of them get enough to drink.\n\n## How Water Reaches All Plants\n\nA good sprinkler makes sure all plants get the same amount of water, no matter if they are close or far from it. It sprays more water close by and less water as it goes further away. This helps all the plants grow well.\n\n## Using Just Enough Water\n\nIt's important to use only the water the plants need, without wasting any. This means setting the sprinkler so it gives just the right amount of water. This helps us save water and makes the plants happy.\n\n## Making Sure All Plants Get Water\n\nThe sprinkler should be able to water a big area so that all plants get water. Sometimes, we can use more than one sprinkler to make sure no plant is left thirsty.\n\n## Examples of Sprinklers in the Field\n\nLet's think about a garden where we put two sprinklers. The first one is set up in the middle, and the second one is a little far from the first. The first sprinkler waters the plants close to it a lot and the plants further away a little. The second sprinkler helps by watering the areas that are further away, so all plants get enough water.\n\n## Chapter 7: Thinking Games\n\nIn this part, we will play a thinking game. Pretend you are a farmer who wants to put a water sprayer in your field. What would you think about when picking a water sprayer? Would you look at how the water comes out, how much water it uses, or how much space it covers? Why?\n\n## Chapter 8: Ending\n\nTo finish, a good water sprayer should spread water evenly, use only the water the plants need, and cover a big space. By knowing these simple ideas about water sprayers, farmers can pick the best one for their plants and help them grow well.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5111, "idx": 447242, "original text": "This invention relates primarily to sprinklers especially those for agricultural uses.\nThe effectiveness of sprinklers can be judged by a number of different factors. The first factor is the water distribution pattern. Ideally, the amount of water per unit area would be directly proportional to the distance from the sprinkler. For example, an ideal sprinkler may provide 2 liters of water per given area at the sprinkler, 1.5 liters at 10 feet (3 m) from the sprinkler, 1 liter at 20 feet (6 m), 0.5 liters at 30 feet (9 m) and no water at 40 feet (12 m), the falloff in the amount of water would be relatively constant over distance. Then, a second sprinkler could be mounted approximately 40 feet (12 m) from the first with the same distribution pattern so that the second sprinkler would add 2 liters of water 40 feet (12 m) from the first sprinkler, 1.5 liters at 30 feet (9 m) from the first sprinkler, 1 liter at 20 feet (6 m), 0.5 liters at 10 feet (3 m) and no additional water at the first sprinkler. Adding the water that both sprinklers provide yields 2 liters per given area over the entire field, and even watering is ideal.\nMetric conversions of inches, feet and pounds are approximations and are frequently rounded off.\nUnfortunately, prior art sprinklers have large amounts of variability in their distribution pattern. There are peaks and there are depressions in the distribution curve. Certain nozzles may have extremely low distribution in the center of their distance. If the low point coincides with the low point of an adjacent sprinkler, certain field areas will receive less than the necessary amount of water. Likewise, other areas may receive too much water.\nOne of the problems with prior art nozzles is in causing the fluid flow to break from a narrow stream, and one of the objects of the present invention is to disclose and provide a nozzle which does disburse the main stream.\nSome prior art nozzles attempt to break the main stream by use of elevated pressures. For example, it is not uncommon to run agricultural sprinklers at 60 to 70 psi (4218-4920 g/cm.sup.2). High pressures create two major problems. First, there is a substantially larger energy consumption in high pressure systems than in lower pressure ones. The cost of power for irrigation is not insubstantial. For example, in California's Central Valley, large farms spend over one million dollars for power for irrigation. Much of the power is obtained from hydro generators driven by the irrigation water itself as it flows from the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. That power could be used elsewhere, however, if it were not necessary for agricultural uses.\nA second problem deals with droplet size. It is believed that in the high pressure systems, an extremely small droplet size is obtained. Therefore, during sprinkling more water is vaporized and less falls on the ground. This wastes precious water by itself, but the effects of such wastefullness are compounded. Because less water reaches the field in a given period of time, the length of watering must be increased often into the high temperature, low humidity daytime, climatic conditions that are relatively common in the western United States. Under these conditions, much of the irrigation water evaporates either from the sprinkler or as it is lying on the ground before it can penetrate the soil. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to disclose and provide a sprinkling system that can operate under lower pressures so that droplet size can be increased, distribution of water over time can be increased, and pressure and power consumption can be reduced.\nThe nozzle of the present invention is designed to operate at approximately 30 psi (2109 g/cm.sup.2), and as described in more detail hereinafter, it distributes more water in a more even distribution than a standard one delivers at its higher pressure.\nThe orifice of this sprinkler is larger than the diameter of nozzles of standard sprinklers, but because of the decreased efficiency of orifices relative to nozzles, excessive amounts of water are not delivered. The larger orifice passes debris that would otherwise clog smaller orifices or nozzles. Also, the buildup of deposits of salts is less critical in a large nozzle than in a small one. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to disclose and provide a nozzle which can utilize a larger orifice for prevention of clogs from debris.\nAnother object of the present invention is to disclose and provide a low cost nozzle. In some prior art nozzles, the housing and orifice plate are one piece of material. It is advantageous to make the orifice plate of wear resistant material such as stainless steel or carbide for resistance of wear from water passing through the orifice. However, there is no necessity that the orifice housing be of wear resistant material; to do so increases the cost. It is beneficial, therefore, to make the orifice housing out of low cost brass or plastic.\nThe present invention also solves additional objects that will become evident in the foregoing specification.", "hash": "05f529287b93a70c18975c7a26b91a79a113536d44770ae2349353c05e0f3e12"}
{"text": "Lesson: Keeping Farm Secrets Safe\n## Section 1: Why It's Important to Keep Farm Secrets Safe\nFarm secrets are very important for farmers. Farmers find out things about their plants, dirt, weather, and more to help them decide when to plant and pick their crops. But, other people might want to know these secrets too, to use them to sell things or learn something. That's why farmers need to know how to keep their farm secrets safe.\n\n## Section 2: Rules for Keeping Farm Secrets Safe\nA big group of farmers made some rules to keep farm secrets safe. Here are some of the rules:\n- Who Can Know: Farmers get to decide who can know and use their secrets. If someone else wants to know, they need to ask the farmer first.\n- Owning Secrets: Farmers own their secrets and can choose if they want to share them or not.\n- Clear Rules: Farmers should know how their secrets are used and who knows them.\n- Being Responsible: If someone uses farm secrets, they need to be careful and not let them get lost or taken by someone else.\n\n## Section 3: Examples of How to Keep Secrets Safe\nImagine a farmer works with a company that helps them know more about their crops. If this company shares the farmer's secrets without asking, that's not following the rules.\nIf a farmer lets a science person know their secrets but then decides not to share anymore, they can take back their permission. If the science person doesn't listen, they are not following the rules.\n\n## Section 4: Conclusion\nKeeping farm secrets safe is very important. By knowing and following the rules, farmers make sure their secrets are safe.

{"text": "Lesson: Why It's Good to Keep Trying\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn why it is good to keep trying to reach our goals. We will hear about a person who had a big problem but did not stop trying until they solved it.\n\nMain Topic:\n1. Why Keeping Trying is Important\n2. Stories of Not Giving Up\n3. Using Not Giving Up in Everyday Life\n\n1. Why Keeping Trying is Important\n\nKeeping trying means not stopping your work towards a goal, even when there are hard times. It is very important because it helps us reach our goals and solve problems. If we stop trying too soon, we might not find out that we can actually do it.\n\n2. Stories of Not Giving Up\n\nIn the story, the person had a problem when they found out something new was coming and they had no more teams to use. Instead of stopping, they kept working on their team and added new members. This helped them keep going and reach their goal of making their team bigger.\n\nAnother story is about a man named Thomas who made a light that we all use today. But Thomas had to try many, many times before he made a light that worked. He did not stop trying, and because of that, he finally did it.\n\n3. Using Not Giving Up in Everyday Life\n\nNot giving up is very important in many parts of life. Here are some ways it helps us:\n\n- Learning: When learning is hard, we might want to stop. But if we keep trying and ask for help, we can understand and do well.\n  \n- Sports: Players sometimes get hurt or don't win games. If they keep practicing and dont give up, they can get better and win next time.\n\n- Jobs: At work, we might find hard tasks or tough people. If we keep trying and dont stop, we can finish our work well and make things better at our job.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end, not giving up is very important for reaching our goals. By working hard even when it's tough, we can do well and fix problems. From the stories we heard, like the person who kept adding to their team and Thomas who made the light, we learn that we should keep trying in everything we do. A deck is a special place outside where you can play, have fun, or keep things. To make a deck, you need to plan, design, and build it well so it is safe, lasts long, and looks nice.\n\nSection 1: Making Plans for a Deck\n\nTopic 1: Picking a Spot\nThe first step to make a deck is to pick the right spot. This place should be flat, steady, and get lots of sunlight. It should be easy to walk to from your house and let you see all around.\n\nTopic 2: How Big and What Shape\nHow big your deck is and what shape it is depends on how much room you have and what you want to do there. The deck should have enough space for your games and chairs. It can be a square, a circle, or any shape that fits well in your yard and for what you want to use it.\n\nTopic 3: Choosing Materials\nThe things you use to build your deck should be strong, look good, and be safe. You can use wood, mixed materials, or stone. Each one has good things and not-so-good things about it. Your choice depends on how much you want to spend, how much work you want to do to keep it up, and how you want it to look.\n\nTopic 4: Drawing the Deck\nOnce you know where it will be, how big, and what shape, you can make a drawing of the deck. Your deck should look nice with your house and the yard around it. Make sure theres enough room to walk and play.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- What should you think about when picking a spot for a deck?\n- How do the size and shape of a deck make it better to use?\n- What are the good and bad points of different materials for making decks?\n- How can the design of the deck look nice with your house and yard?\n\nSection 2: Building the Deck\n\nTopic 1: Getting the Place Ready\nBefore you start building, you need to clean the area and make the ground flat. Make sure you have permission to build your deck.\n\nTopic 2: Putting in the Supports\nSupports hold up your deck. You must put them in as the rules say and deep enough to hold the deck up well. They should be placed right to handle the weight.\n\nTopic 3: Making the Frame\nThe frame is what holds up the whole deck. It should be made of strong wood or metal and set up following the rules.\n\nTopic 4: Putting on the Top\nThe top part of the deck is where you stand or play. It should be strong and set up right following the rules.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- What do we do to get ready to build a deck?\n- Why do we put in strong supports and a frame to make the deck safe?\n- What are some materials we can use to make the top of a deck, and which is the strongest?\n- How do we make sure the deck is strong enough for people and chairs?\n\nGetting the Deck Done\n\nTopic 1: Putting Up Railings\nRailings keep us safe. We put them up as told and follow the rules. We pick the railing's look and what it's made of to make the deck pretty.\n\nTopic 2: Putting in Lights\nLights make the deck look nice and let us use it when it's dark. We put lights up as told and follow the rules. The kind and how many lights we use depends on how big the deck is and what we use it for.\n\nTopic 3: Checking Everything\nAfter we build the deck, we check to make sure everything is okay and safe. We fix anything that's not right before we start using the deck.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- What do we need to think about for safety when we put up railings on a deck?\n- How do lights make the deck look better and work better?\n- Why is it important to check everything is okay before we use the deck?\n\nWords to Know:\n- Supports: Things that hold up the deck.\n- Frame: The strong shape that holds up the deck's top.\n- Deck's top: The part of the deck we walk on.\n- Railings: Things that keep us from falling off the deck.\n- Lights: Things that make the deck bright and pretty.\n\nIn the End:\nWhen we build a deck, we need to plan well. We choose the place, size, shape, materials, and look we like. We build the deck by following the rules and instructions to make sure it's safe and lasts long. By learning from this part, you can make a great deck that you will enjoy for many years.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 789, "idx": 367248, "original text": "Warhammer: 40,000.

{"text": "Lesson: The House Trouble\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will talk about how two groups of leaders argue about house troubles and how it changes life for everyone in the place.\n\nSection 1: Understanding the House Trouble\n\nTopic 1: What is the House Trouble?\nThe house trouble happens when there are not enough homes that people can pay for. This makes some people have no homes, pay a lot for rent, or live in very full houses.\n\nTopic 2: Why is there a House Trouble?\nThere are many reasons for the house trouble. One reason is that many people need houses, but there are not enough houses. Another reason is that it costs a lot to build new homes, which makes it hard to build homes that dont cost too much.\n\nTopic 3: Who is affected by the House Trouble?\nThe house trouble touches everyone. Families who can't buy a home, young people just starting, and older people with set money are all affected by not having enough affordable homes.\n\nSection 2: The Role of the Home Leader\n\nTopic 1: What does the Home Leader do?\nThe Home Leader looks after the country's home rules and projects. They make sure everyone can find a safe and affordable place to live.\n\nTopic 2: How does the Home Leader address the House Trouble?\nThe Home Leader might make new rules to have more affordable homes, give money for home projects, and work with local leaders to help with the house trouble in their areas.\n\nSection 3: The Argument and the City Leaders\n\nTopic 1: What is the City Leaders?\nThe City Leaders are the local leaders for a big city. They take care of the citys buildings, services, and plans.\n\nTopic 2: How do the City Leaders address the House Trouble?\nThe City Leaders might say yes to new home places, make zones for homes, and give money for affordable home projects.\n\nTopic 3: The Argument\nIn this story, the Home Leader and the City Leaders blame each other for not fixing the house trouble fast. The Home Leader says the City Leaders dont want new homes near them, while the City Leaders say the bigger leaders arent helping enough.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, the house trouble is a big problem that needs everyone to work together. By knowing what the Home Leader and the City Leaders do, we can see how they try (or dont try) to fix the problem.

{"text": "Lesson: What is Energy from Atoms?\nIntroduction:\nTalking about atom energy can bring up different feelings. Some think it's a good and strong way to make power, while others worry it can be very risky and cause big accidents. In this lesson, we learn the simple parts of atom energy, its good sides, and its risks.\nSection 1: What is Atom Energy?\nAtom energy is a kind of power made by breaking the center of an atom. This break releases a lot of power, which can be used to make electricity. [PARAGRAPH]The most common type of nuclear power plant uses uranium as fuel. When uranium is split, it releases heat, which is used to boil water and create steam. The steam drives turbines, which generate electricity.\nSection 2: Benefits of Nuclear Power\nOne of the main benefits of nuclear power is that it is a clean source of energy. When it is generated correctly, nuclear power does not produce any greenhouse gases or other pollutants that contribute to climate change. Additionally, nuclear power plants are able to generate a large amount of electricity, making them a reliable source of energy.\nSection 3: Risks of Nuclear Power\nDespite its benefits, nuclear power does come with some risks. One of the biggest risks is the potential for accidents like the one that happened at Chernobyl. If there is a failure in the containment system, it can release radioactive materials into the environment. This can have serious health consequences for people who are exposed to the radiation. Additionally, nuclear waste is a long-lasting problem. It must be stored safely for thousands of years, and there is always the risk that it could be stolen or leaked into the environment.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, nuclear power is a complex topic that requires careful consideration. While it has many benefits, such as being a clean source of energy, it also comes with risks. By understanding the basics of nuclear power and its potential dangers, we can make informed decisions about its use in the future.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 694, "idx": 210970, "original text": "What If Chernobyl Was A Sitcom?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Earnings and Their Role\n\nIntroduction:\nEarnings tell us how much money a company makes. They help us understand if a company is doing well. In this lesson, we will learn about earnings and how they help us know a company's value.\n\nSection 1: Learning About Earnings\n\nEarnings are what a company earns after paying all it needs, like taxes. They show up on a list called an income statement and are a very important number.\n\nWhy are earnings important?\n\nEarnings are important because they tell us if a company is doing well with money. A company with good earnings usually has enough money to grow, which can make the company's value go up. But if a company's earnings are low, it might mean it's not doing so well.\n\nWhat are some simple ideas about money stories?\n\nSome people think that less money for a thing is always better than more money for it. But this isn't always true. Sometimes, if a thing costs more, it might mean that people think it will be worth more later. Another simple idea is that just because a company makes a lot of money, it doesn't mean it's always a good choice to give them your money. There are other things to think about, like how much debt the company has, if it is doing better than other companies, and if the people making decisions are good at their jobs.\n\nHow do we look at money stories?\n\nTo understand money stories, you need to look carefully. Start by seeing if the company has been making more money or less money over time. Then, see if the thing costs more compared to how much money it makes. This doesn't always mean it's too expensive, especially if the company might grow a lot. Finally, you can look at how much money you might make compared to how much you pay for the thing.\n\nWhat should we ask about money stories?\n\nWhen looking at money stories, ask these things:\n- Has the company been making more money over time?\n- Is the company better than others at what it does?\n- Does the company owe a lot of money, and could this be a problem for making more money later?\n- Are the people who make big decisions good at making the company successful?\n\nHow can we use money stories to make choices?\n\nMoney stories can help us decide if we should buy, sell, or keep something. Heres how you can use them:\n1. Look at how much money the company has made and if its going up or down.\n2. Compare how much the thing costs to how much money it makes, and see if it's similar to other companies like it.\n3. See how the company's price compares to its money-making to understand if the price is fair.\n4. Think about if the company has any big problems that might make it hard to make money later.\n5. Lastly, think about if the people running the company are good at making it successful.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLearning about how companies make money is important. We look at how much money a company makes and how it has changed over time. This helps us understand if a company is doing well. It's good to ask questions and think carefully about what you learn. Knowing this helps people make good choices when they decide where to put their money.\n\nGlossary:\n\n- Money Made: Money a company keeps after paying for everything it needs to pay.\n- Stock Price: How much you pay for a piece of the company.\n- Money Compared to Price: This helps you see if the price of the company is good compared to how much money it makes.\n- Money Owed: How much money a company needs to pay back.\n- Standing in Industry: How well the company is doing compared to other similar companies.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1948, "idx": 285768, "original text": "Earnings: The Indispensable Element Of Great Stocks\n\nWatching For Pitfalls\n\nInvestors can easily be misled by popular myths about\nearnings.\n\nMyth: You should buy stocks\nwith low price-to-earnings (P-E) ratios.\n\nThe P-E ratio is a comparison of the stock's price\nto its annual earnings per share.

In this lesson, we will learn how to look at and understand maps.\n\nSection 1: Types of Maps\n\nMaps can be different, each showing us different things:\n\n1. Maps with colors: These maps show where countries and cities are. They use colors to show different areas.\n\n2. Maps with mountains and rivers: These maps show the land like mountains, rivers, and trees. \n\n3. Maps with lines: These maps have lines that go up and down. They help us see how high or low the land is. They are good for when we go hiking.\n\n4. Maps with weather: These maps tell us what the weather is like, if it is hot or cold, or if it will rain.\n\n5. Maps with roads: These maps show where roads and highways are. They help us know how to go places.\n\nSection 2: Reading Maps\n\nTo understand maps, we need to know what the pictures and signs mean:\n\n1. Lines that connect: These lines on maps show how high the land is. \n\n2. Map Key: This is a list that tells us what each picture or sign on the map means.\n\n3. Legend: This also tells us what each sign on the map means.\n\n4. Compass Rose: This shows us where north, south, east, and west are. It helps us know which way to go.\n\n5. Scale: This helps us understand how big something on the map is in the real world.\n\nSection 3: Understanding Maps\n\nNow that we know how to read maps, we can start to use them. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Look for patterns: Notice how things are placed on the map. For example, on a weather map, you might see that some places are sunny and others are rainy.\n\n2. Compare maps: If we are learning about a place, we can look at different maps to know more about it. You can look at two types of maps: one that shows land shapes and another that shows areas managed by different leaders. This helps you see how the land shapes connect with the areas leaders manage.\n\nMaps help us learn about the world.

{"text": "Lesson Title: About Citrus Trees\n\nIntroduction:\nCitrus trees need lots of food to stay healthy. We will talk about why some leaves on these trees turn yellow and what food helps them grow.\n\nSection 1: Food for Citrus Trees\n\nWhy Do Citrus Trees Need Food?\nCitrus trees need different kinds of food to grow big and strong. They need this food to make leaves, fruits, and to stay healthy. Some important foods for these trees are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\nHow Food Helps Citrus Trees\nFood helps citrus trees in many ways. Nitrogen makes the leaves green. Phosphorus helps make roots and fruits. Potassium keeps the tree healthy so it doesn't get sick easily.\n\nSection 2: When Citrus Trees Don't Get Enough Food\n\nWhat Happens When Trees Don't Get Enough Food?\nIf a citrus tree doesn't get enough food, its leaves might turn yellow. Sometimes the tree doesn't grow well, and it doesn't make many fruits. This could be because it doesn't have enough food, or it might be sick.\n\nHow to Find Out What Food the Tree Needs\nTo find out what food a tree needs, you can check the dirt around it. This test tells you what is in the dirt and what is missing. You can also look at the tree's leaves to see if they are missing any food.\n\nSection 3: Giving Food to Citrus Trees\n\nWhat Kind of Food to Give Citrus Trees\nThere are special foods for citrus trees. These foods help give the tree all the nutrients it needs to grow well. [PARAGRAPH]These include organic fertilizers, such as compost and manure, and synthetic fertilizers, such as 10-10-10 and other balanced fertilizers.\n\nTopic 2: How to Apply Fertilizers to Citrus Trees\nTo apply fertilizers to citrus trees, you will need to follow the package instructions carefully. Generally, you will need to dilute the fertilizer according to the recommended ratio and apply it to the soil surrounding the tree. You may also need to water the tree after applying the fertilizer.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, understanding the importance of nutrients for citrus trees and identifying nutrient deficiencies is crucial for maintaining their health. By providing the necessary nutrients through fertilizers, you can help your citrus trees grow strong and produce healthy fruits. Remember to always follow the package instructions when applying fertilizers to avoid over-fertilizing or under-fertilizing your trees.\n\nGlossary:\n- Nitrogen: A nutrient that helps in the production of chlorophyll and promotes leaf growth.\n- Phosphorus: A nutrient that is essential for the formation of roots, flowers, and fruits.\n- Potassium: A nutrient that helps in improving the tree's resistance to diseases and pests.\n- Calcium: A nutrient that is necessary for the proper development of the tree's structure.\n- Magnesium: A nutrient that is essential for the overall health of the tree.\n- Iron: A nutrient that is crucial for the production of chlorophyll and the overall health of the tree.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 795, "idx": 236710, "original text": "Q&A: Yellowing Leaves on Container Citrus.

(The leaves aren't falling off, however.) They have been in a greenhouse through the winter so I know that they haven't gotten too cold. What is causing this, and what can I do?. Answer: Citrus are heavy feeders and will quickly use up nutrients in a container situation, so I suspect your trees simply need some supplemental nutrients. If you can find a citrus fertilizer at your local nursery, use that. Otherwise, any all-purpose balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or an organic equivalent will be fine.

Jorg Massen, Universit\u00e4t Wien\n\nRavens have shown complex cooperative abilities previously only seen in a handful of mammalian (and one fish) species. However, collaborations only happen when two ravens trust each other. Birds that have misbehaved by taking more than their fair share are subsequently shunned, an even rarer show of animal intelligence.\n\nDr Jorg Massen of the University of Vienna tested whether pairs of ravens could cooperate for food. A platform, carrying two pieces of cheese, was placed outside a cage with string threaded through attached loops.\n\nCaged ravens could swing the platform close enough to reach the cheese by pulling on the string. However, this required both ends of the string to be pulled simultaneously. If one raven pulled the string alone it would unthread, depriving them both of cheese.\n\nOnly by working together could the ravens pull the platform towardss them. Credit:Nadja Kavcik-Graumann\n\nIn Scientific Reports Massen and co-authors reveal that from 600 trials using different self-selected combinations of birds there were 397 successes (66.2%). Every raven got some cheese, but some combinations worked far better than others.\n\nRavens apparently really like cheese, and the most dominant birds monopolized the platform, rather than getting equal time. Massen repeated the process, this time giving each bird an equal go, both at the platform and in all the possible partnerships.\n\nDespite potential learning from the first trials, success was much lower, just 27.3%, when birds were assigned their partners. Of 36 possible pairings, 15 never worked together successfully.\n\nIn line with previous studies, the one consistently important predictor of success was \u201cinter-individual tolerance\u201d, the capacity for two raven to get along.\n\nThe second round of trials found some patterns that had not been observed when the birds self-selected. Male-female pairs worked much better than male-male pairs, with female-female combinations in between. Birds further apart on the dominance hierarchy worked together better than those that were close together.\n\nThe novel part of Massen's findings was the way the ravens responded to cheaters. Although the cheese was placed so that each bird could get one piece, sometimes a fast-moving individual would eat both pieces before the other could get its share. Birds that had been on the receiving end of such bad behavior usually refused to cooperate with the offender again.\n\n\"Such a sophisticated way of keeping your partner in check has previously only been shown in humans and chimpanzees, and is a complete novelty among birds\" Massen said in a statement.\n\nThe miscreants were not sorry, however. On the rare occasions they were given another chance they were \u201ceven more likely to cheat again,\u201d the authors note, \u201csuggesting that if they had learned anything, then it was how to cheat.\u201d\n\nDespite being able to learn the value of a good partner, the ravens didn't seem to grasp the importance of checking what a potential partner was doing at the time. Sometimes one bird was presented with the string while the other had only just been allowed into the far end of the cage. Most ravens unthreaded the string before assistance arrived, matching a similar lack of observation from their even more impressively accomplished fellow corvids, New Caledonian crows.", "hash": "e3ef225153a245e6dc82f30bf6b5fc9d88b3caf06dcb9511a4ba0b51b32a64bb"}

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Satellite Television\n\n## Section 1: Learning About TV From Space\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about a special way to watch TV called TV from space. It is a special TV service that uses space tools to send TV shows to us. It is different from the usual TV wires and has some good things about it.\n\n### Questions and Answers\n\n**Question:** What is TV from space?\n\n**Answer:** TV from space is a special service that sends TV shows to us using space tools.\n\n**Question:** How does TV from space work?\n\n**Answer:** TV from space sends signals from a space tool to a box at home, which shows the TV shows on our TV.\n\n## Section 2: Examples\n\nLet's see how TV from space works with some examples. One example is the Dish Network, which is a popular TV from space service. They use a big dish to catch signals from space. The signals go to a box, which sends them to the TV.\n\nAnother example is how we set up TV from space at home. A helper comes to put a big dish, a box, and a wire at your home. After setting up, the helper makes sure everything works well so you can watch clear TV shows.\n\n## Section 3: When TV From Space is Helpful\n\nNow, let's think about when TV from space is a good choice. If you live in a place where it's hard to get usual TV wires, TV from space can be great. If you like watching sports that you can't see on local TV, TV from space can show those games.\n\nAlso, if you travel a lot and want to watch your favorite shows, you can bring a small dish and a box to watch TV from anywhere.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- Space tool: Something made by people and sent to space to help us learn or to send TV shows.\n- Box: A device that gets and shows TV signals.\n- Wire: A long, thin piece used to send signals.\n- TV: A device that shows TV shows.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTV from space is a great choice if you want more TV shows or if you need TV in hard-to-reach places. With its many good points, like watching more channels and TV from anywhere, it's a popular choice for many people.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 957, "idx": 260028, "original text": "DISH Network Specialists. in Sunset, Florida.

{"text": "Lesson: Dressing Up Fun\n\nIntroduction:\nDressing up like characters from stories or games is fun! It takes some work, but we can do it together step by step, starting with the hair and ending with the little extras.\n\nSection 1: The Hair\nThe hair is the first thing people see. It's important to pick the right hair look and color. We'll learn how to pick the best hair for dressing up.\n\nTheory: Think about the character. If they are bold, choose a bright hair color. If they are quiet, pick a softer color.\n\nPractice: Let's pretend to be a brave boy with dark hair. You might pick a medium-short, grey wig.\n\nSection 2: The Hat\nMany dress-up outfits need a hat. It makes the outfit look even better. We will make a hat from scratch.\n\nTheory: Think about the hat's shape and what to make it from. You can use foam, cloth, or paper.\n\nPractice: If you want to dress up as a wizard with a tall hat, start with a foam base. Add cloth to shape it. You can put ribbons or other fun things on it to make it special.\n\nSection 3: The Extras\nThe little extras make your outfit special. These can be things like a pretend sword, a magic wand, or even shiny things like jewelry.\n\nTheory: Think about who the character is. A warrior might need a sword, and a magician might need a wand.\n\nPractice: Imagine you're a cookie. You could make pretend cookie sticks from sticks and paper. Make a pretend chocolate seal with foam, glue, and paint.\n\nConclusion:\nMaking your own dress-up outfit is great fun and very creative. [PARAGRAPH]By following the steps in this lesson, you can create a costume that is both accurate and stylish. Remember to have fun and be creative, and you will surely create a cosplay costume that is both impressive and enjoyable.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3684, "idx": 329286, "original text": "I will say up front, I KNOW a lot of this costume is Not Right. I know it. But after so many hours of trying and trying to get it right, with the dying, and the trim-work, and the sewing, and the hunting... I just couldn't take it anymore. I focused more on making it look good, rather than worrying too much about accuracy, and even now, I'm no so sure I succeeded on the Looking Good part. As Always, I'll start from the top and work my way down.\nThe wig was purchased from Cosplay.com Shopping, and is a Medium Bob in Slate Grey. I trimmed into to that style, and luckily, it wasn't much work. The hat is made 100% from scratch. I started by building it with craft foam, and then creating the melted effect on top with LOTS AND LOTS of hot glue. The ribbon, while not accurate to the picture, is something I found at fabric depot. The Chocolate Seal is made out of craft foam, hot glue, and spray paint. the cookie sticks were made by my friend Kayla using small wooden dowels, and scrapbooking paper. I used a brown 'satin finish' paint on the majority of the hat, and a black gloss on the brim. The eyepatch cookie is made out of sculpy, and was also made by Kayla.\nThe jacket and pants are made using a brown polyester suiting, white crepe-suiting, and lined in a gold-ish party taffeta. I used a Napoleon/French Revolution costume pattern as a base for the jacket, and made modifications here and there to get closer to what I envisioned it must look like under Lizzie's hair. The cuffs were made from a hand-dyed stripe curtain taffeta, and are trimmed in a brown twist piping. The pants are made from a women's slacks pattern, which I then had to draft a pattern to add the cuffs to the pants. The stripes down the sides are satin-stitched, and made of the same taffeta that I lined the jacket with. The ruffle cuffs are made of a cotton/polyester blend eyelet fabric, that I dyed ti give it that yellowed, aged look. The vest is made from the same fabric as the cuffs, but in a different color, and trimmed with the same piping. The ruffles is made from the same white crepe suiting that I used on the contrast pieces of the jacket. Each cuff and the front of the jacket have stripes of satin-stitched applique work to create the illusion of large button holes... or whatever those are supposed to be in the illustration, because lord knows I don't know enough about period clothing to do it authentically.\nThe sash is made from a banana-yellow Casa Satin, as so is the 'ribbon' -- I made it myself by doing box pleats, and then gathering it into a spiral. The chocolate crown in the center is made from craft foam, hot glue, modeling clay, varnish, and the same satin-finish spray paint that I used on the hat. The gloves were a pair of black costume gloves I had from a Halloween costume, and were bought at the local year-round Halloween store.\nAlmost done! The socks are just a pair of brown trouser-socks I bought at the drug store. the 'garters' on top where made out of a stretch lace that I had to sew together to get the scallops on top AND bottom, and the ribbon is just that -- a yellow ribbon. I could not figure out how to get diagonal stripes on nylon socks, so I didn't bother. XD the shoes are a pair of black victorian-style boots I got for 2 bucks at a garage sale AGES ago, that I painted the soles and heels on, and then drafted a Spats pattern to go over it.\nAnd after all that, can you believe I want to do MORE of this stuff? XD\n\nPersonal Thoughts:\n\nAlthough I'm very proud of the work that went into this, and the actual construction of the final piece, I am very disappointed in how I look in it. I think the design just isn't very flattering on me.", "hash": "b64ffa89059117620c2f0bd6d9f5ef7874db18c5fb2e1554707f712fd0e5cbbd"}

The first type makes sure everything on the page sits right, like words and pictures. The second type makes everything look nice, like choosing colors and making things move.\nIn this lesson, we learn about these two types, why they are important, and how they work together to make lovely and working web pages.\n### Section 2: Learning About Web Page Codes\nThe first type of code is always getting better. It helps tell where things like headings and paragraphs should go. It has new parts that help make web pages do more fun things, like playing videos.\nThe second type of code also gets better. It lets us add styles like colors and shapes to the page. It has new tricks that help make pages fun, like making things move or change shape.\n### Section 3: Using the Codes\nTo use these codes, we need to know some basic rules. Here are some important things to remember:\n- New parts in the first code let us make different sections like a header or a footer.\n- Special settings in the first code let us add extra details to parts of the web page.\n- The second code has ways to pick certain parts to style.\n- The second code has settings for making things move or change during viewing.\n### Section 4: Fun Examples\nNow, let's see how to use these codes to make a web page look great:\n- First Example: Making a page that changes layout depending on the screen size.\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>Fun Page</title>\n    <style>\n      @media (max-width: 768px) {\n[PARAGRAPH]In this example, we use the media query feature of CSS3 to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. When the screen width is below 768 pixels, the container element takes up the full width of the screen.\n- Example 2: Adding multimedia content using HTML5 and CSS3\nIn this example, we use HTML5 multimedia elements such as img, audio, and video to add images, audio, and video content to our web page. We also use CSS3 to style these elements and make them visually appealing.\n### Section 5: Conclusion\nHTML5 and CSS3 are two essential languages for front-end web development. They work together to create visually appealing and functional web pages that are easy to use and accessible to all users.

{"text": "Sure, here's a simple lesson on making arrays with columns:\n# Making Arrays with Columns\nIn this lesson, we will learn about making arrays with columns, which helps when we have lots of things to keep track of.\n## Section 1: Introduction\nAn array is a way to keep many things of the same kind together. We use arrays to hold and use information. When we have a lot of information, it can be hard to keep it neat and use it well. A good way to help with this is by making groups of information called arrays with different sections, like a list.\n\n## Section 2: Making Groups of Information\nTo make a group of information with sections, we decide what kind of sections we want. For example, if we have different fruits, we could make a group with sections for the fruit's name, color, and price. We can make this group by thinking about each fruit and what we know about it, and then writing it down in a list.\n\nIn our example, we first think of the fruits and the sections we want. Then, we look at each fruit and each section and write down what goes in each part. At the end, we have a list where each smaller list shows us information about each fruit.\n\n## Section 3: Using Groups of Information\nNow that we have our group of information with sections, we can use it to understand our data better. For example, we can find out the average price of the fruits:\n\n```python\ntotal_price = 0\nnum_fruits = len(group)\nfor row in group:\n    total_price += sum(row)\navg_price = total_price / num_fruits\n```\nHere, we start by setting the total price to zero and count how many fruits we have. Then, we look at each fruit's information and add up the prices. In the end, we find out the average price by dividing the total price by the number of fruits.\n\n## Section 4: Conclusion\nMaking groups of information with sections is a great way to handle a lot of data. By organizing the information into sections, we can work with it more easily and do calculations on different parts. In this lesson, we learned how to make these groups, use them to keep and work with data, and how they can be used in real situations.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1219, "idx": 410100, "original text": "Q:\n\nCreate an array with Columns?\n\nI am creating a Multithreaded application that processes data very fast, so fast that I realized that windows controls couldn't keep up, and would create issues.\nSo my new solution is that I am going to store results into an array and update a ListBox or ListView at the end.\nNow my question is this:  \nIn my application the user enters items into a ListBox my application then checks for these items.  \nHow can I create an array with a column for every value in the ListBox, Adding the column name as a column header(I am guessing just add it as first value for each column).  \nThe thing is the amount of rows would be impossible to tell before hand so it would need to be able to support any amount. \nIs this a feasible idea, and if so could anyone help me in doing this?\n\nA:\n\nI suggest going with a DataTable because as a data structure it is well aligned with a database and it performs well with a large number of rows - that is kind of what it is designed for. It also allows you to apply a layer of structure onto your data that you wouldn't get with either a List or an array (under the hood a DataTable is not much more than an array so the performance will be comparable).\n\n", "hash": "1cd6cc93c0f0583bd9111175495f7ca80b17c26fe40071593682b75e829602f4"}
{"text": "Lesson: Fun with Rafting Gear\n\n## Section 1: Rafting Gear\n\nRafting is a fun water activity where you ride on a bouncy boat on wavy water. It's important to have good gear to stay safe and have fun. We'll learn about the different things you need for rafting.\n\n## Section 2: What We Use\n\n1. Life Jackets: The most important thing is a life jacket. It helps you float and keeps you safe if you fall into the water. Make sure it fits you just right.\n\n2. Helmets: Helmets keep your head safe from bumps. Always wear one that fits snugly.\n\n3. Paddles: Paddles help you move and steer the raft. Pick one that's easy for you to hold.\n\n4. Wetsuits: Wetsuits keep you warm in cold water. They feel like a snug, cozy layer.\n\n5. Dry Bags: Dry bags keep your things dry like toys or snacks. They float, so you can find them if they drop in the water.\n\n6. Safety Gear: This includes ropes and other helpful things to keep everyone safe and help anyone who might need it.\n\n7. First Aid Kit: This kit has bandages and clean wipes for any small booboos.\n\n## Section 3: Fun Questions\n\n1. Why do we wear life jackets in the raft?\nAnswer: Life jackets help us float and keep us safe in the water.\n\n2. How does a wetsuit help us in the water?\nAnswer: Wetsuits keep us warm and comfy in cold water.\n\n3. What do we use paddles for in rafting?\nAnswer: Paddles help us move the raft and go where we want in the water. It is very important to be safe and have fun on the river.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo have a good time rafting, you need the right safe gear. Knowing about different things you can bring helps you choose wisely. Always think of safety first and use your gear right to enjoy your river adventure.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 895, "idx": 403562, "original text": "During your whitewater rafting adventure one of the most important things is having the right equipment.
