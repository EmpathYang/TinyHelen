If the mistake is made in DC city, the DC city Court looks into it. In situations involving big government property or workers, the big courts may look into it. It's the same in AU country.\nIf the person who got hurt is a big official, an ambassador, consul or other foreign official under US protection, then the big government looks into it. If the mistake happened on big government property or involved going across state lines it is under big government control. Mistakes on boats or US flagged merchant ships in big waters is under big government control. This is also true if the mistake happens on US country soldier bases worldwide. Doing something very bad, like hurting someone until they are not alive anymore, by a person who works for the US army is against the rules. If this happens, there is a big meeting to decide what happens to that person.\nIn US, if someone does this bad thing, both the place where it happened and the whole country can have their own meetings about it.

A group of people who live together, follow the same rules, and do things together is called a society.\\nA man named Ethan first used this word a long time ago. Problems that happened when a lot of people moved to cities and worked in big buildings were one of the first things sociologists looked at. Adam, Max, and David were some of the first people to study this. They looked at things like: groups, leaders, being important, feeling left out and not having power.\\nNow, some sociologists look at things like: what people look like, where they come from, if they have a lot of money or not, if they are a boy or girl, families and how people talk to each other. They also look at when things go wrong, like when people do bad things or when families break apart.\\nSociologists look at things that make up a society, like what people look like, if they are a boy or girl, and if they have a lot of money or not. They look at families and problems like doing bad things and not doing what they are supposed to do.\\nMost sociologists focus on one or more special areas. Sociology includes many special areas that look at different parts of a society. For example, one area looks at who has more and who has less in a society. Another area looks at changes in the number or kind of people. Another area looks at bad behavior and crime. People study how rules and leaders work. They also look at how we think about things like colors of skin and boys and girls.\\nSome people who study these things do their work outside of school. They want to help teachers, rule makers, and leaders make better schools, programs, and rules.\\nThese people often use numbers to see patterns in how people act. They also talk to people or have group talks to understand why people act in certain ways. Some use different ways to do their research.\\nPeople have been trying to understand how people and groups act together since a long time ago. This kind of study became an important thing in the early 1800s. Many cities were changing as lots of people moved into cities and started working in big buildings. These people tried to understand how people and groups acted together.\\nThe word for this study was made up by a man from FR country named Ethan in 1780. Early people who wrote about this included Adam and Matthew.\\nThis was taught in a university for the first time at KA university in 1890. The first place in EU for this study was started in 1895 at BO university by a man named David. The first place in BR for this study was at LO school in 1904.

{"idx": 32009, "text": "Madison v. Alice\nMadison v. Alice, , was a big decision made by the US judges. The judges said that a person who is with the police must be told that they can talk to a lawyer before and during any questions. They must be told that they have the right to not answer questions. They also must make sure the person understands these rights.\nThe Madison warning (often just called \"Madison,\" or \"Madison-ing\" a person) is the name of the official warning that is required to be given by police in the US to people who might have done something wrong. It must be given before they are asked questions, because of the \"Madison\" decision. Its purpose is to make sure the person knows about these rights under the US laws. Also so they know they can use them at any time during the talk.\nOn a day in March, Ethan Madison was taken by police officers in PH city, AR state. Ethan asked why he was being taken but was not told why. Once upon a time, a man named Ethan was taken by the police, but they didn't tell him why. Ten days before this, an 18-year-old girl said someone hurt her. When she told the police, her story kept changing. A few days later, she was going home from work and saw a scary car. She thought it might be the same car from when she got hurt. She saw part of the car's number and told the police. The police found Ethan and asked him some questions. The girl couldn't point out who hurt her but said Ethan looked a bit like him. During the talk with Ethan, the police told him he didn't do well in the lineup. After a long talk, Ethan finally said he did it. The police also got Ethan to say he did two other bad things.\n\nEthan's story, and three other stories like his, were heard by the very top judges. In all four stories, the people didn't have helpers when they were asked questions. The judges made a decision on a summer day in June and the head judge, Earl, read all sixty pages. Four judges didn't agree with the decision. They said that all the people said they did the bad things. They thought that if helpers were there when people were asked questions, then most people wouldn't say they did it.\n\nSo, Ethan's first time being found guilty was taken back, but he had to go back to court in 1967. He couldn't say he did it this time, but the person asking the questions got Ethan's girlfriend to say he told her he did it. Sophia said it happened a few days after his talk with the police. He was seen as bad and got the same punishment again.\nThere are lots of police places in the US country. They use many different ways to tell people they can be quiet. These can be from a few words to a lot. One reason is that many people who need help do not always understand these words. These include those who cannot hear, do not talk or read English well, young people, people who are sick in the head, and or the people who think differently. The judges have not been very helpful to the rights of these people who may not have understood their rights.\nLike the quiet rights, other countries have written rights they give to people before police start their questions. They have steps to make sure a confession is okay in their court places. For example, in CA country if someone is taken by the police they have certain rights. These are to be quickly told why they were taken, told they have a right to get a lawyer and the right to show they should not be held.", "hash": "4073281103fb63b2d23145ce5636eb13a7da75ce3f20060173a70bce5ebf410f"}

{"idx": 37891, "text": "P versus NP\nP versus NP is a big question asked by people who work with machines that can think and with numbers: Can every solved problem whose answer can be checked quickly by a machine also be quickly solved by a machine? P and NP are two kinds of number problems we talk about: P problems are fast for machines to solve, and so are thought to be \"easy\". NP problems are fast (and so \"easy\") for a machine to check, but are not necessarily easy to solve.\nIn a time long, long ago, Kevin wrote a letter to Jack. In this letter, Kevin asked if a certain NP problem could be solved quickly. In a later time, Sam introduced the exact question of the P versus NP problem in his writing \"How Hard It Is To Prove Things\".\nToday, many people think this is a big question in the world of machines that think. It is a very special question that could make someone very rich if they can find the right answer.\nFor example, if you have a question and someone says \"The answer to your question is the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\", a machine might be able to tell you quickly if that answer is right or wrong. But it might take a long time for the machine to think of \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" by itself. Another example is looking for special numbers. It's easy to check if a number is special, but it's very hard to find those numbers to start with. For some fun, useful questions like this, we don't know a quick way to find an answer, but if someone gives us an answer, we can check it quickly. In this way, these questions are like puzzles: it may be hard to find the answer to a puzzle, but once you hear the answer, it seems obvious. So, the big question is: are puzzles really as hard as we think they are, or are we missing something?\nBecause these kinds of \"P versus NP\" questions are so important, many people who are good at numbers, science, and machines want to prove the general idea that every problem that can be checked quickly can also be solved quickly. This question is so important that a big organization will give a lot of money to anyone who can prove it right or wrong.\nLet's think a little more. All red problems are blue problems: it's simple to see if an answer is right by solving the problem and seeing if the two answers are the same. But, people are wondering: Are there any blue problems that are not red problems, or are all blue problems just red problems? If blue problems are really not the same as red problems, it would mean that no quick ways to solve those blue problems exist, no matter how hard we look. But, if all blue problems are red problems, it would mean that new, very fast ways to solve problems do exist. We just have not found them yet.\nSince the best tries of smart people have not found simple ways to solve blue problems yet, many people think that there are blue problems that are not red problems. Most smart people also think this is true, but right now no one has shown it with hard math. If it can be shown that blue and red are the same, it would change many parts of everyday life. For this reason, the question of \"red versus blue\" is a big and much-studied topic.\nLet's say someone wants to build two towers, by stacking rocks of different weights. They want to make sure that each of the towers weighs exactly the same. That means they will have to put the rocks into two piles that weigh the same. If you have a bunch of rocks and you try to guess how to split them into two equal piles, it's easy to check if you're right. (To check, you can split the rocks and use a balance to see if both piles are the same.) This is a problem that people who work with computers call 'Partition'. It's easier to check the answer than to find it from the start.\nHow hard is it to find the answer from the start? If you start with just 100 rocks, there are a lot, a lot, a lot of ways (we can call these combinations) to split these rocks into two piles. If you could check one unique combination of rocks every day, it would take so, so, so many years, more than the universe is old. That means, if you take all the time that has passed since the universe began, you would need to check more than a whole lot of different ways of splitting the rocks \"every second\", in order to check all of the different ways.\nIf you had a big machine and you wanted to find all the ways to split a group of rocks, it would take a very long time, even if the machine worked very fast. Some people think we could find a way to split the rocks evenly without trying all the different ways.\nThe question \"Is P equal to NP?\" is a short way to ask if there is a faster way to do this.\nThere are many problems like this that we don't know how to solve quickly. Here are some examples:\nIn the example above, we see that with a few rocks, there are many ways to split the rocks. With even more rocks, there are even more ways to split them. This is because the number of ways to split the rocks gets bigger and bigger very quickly.\nSo far, for the hard problems, the solutions have taken a very long time. For any particular problem, people have found ways to make it quicker. One might figure out a way to do just a small part of the problem and that saves a lot of time, but it still takes a long time. And every extra rock makes the problem take longer to solve. There are smart ideas that can help solve the problem faster, like using a special rule. But the problem still gets harder as we add more rocks.\nThink about the problem of making a test schedule (like we talked about before). But now imagine there are 15000 students. There's a computer program that makes the schedules for all 15000 students. It takes an hour and gives a test schedule so that all students can take their tests in one week. It follows many rules (like no tests one after the other, no more than 2 tests in a day and so on) to make sure the students are not too stressed. The program runs for one hour at mid-term break and everyone knows when their tests are so they can get ready.\nBut the next year, there are 10 more students. If the same program runs on the same computer, it would take much longer than an hour, because every extra student makes it take longer. That would be a very long time! If there were 20 more students, then it would take even longer.\nSo, for a lot of students, it takes one hour. For more students, it takes a very long time.\nAs you can see, problems can get harder really fast. Most number experts think that the hardest problems need a lot of time to solve.\nSmart people can show that there are some hard problems that are really, really hard. A really, really hard problem is at least as tough to solve as any other hard problem. This means that if someone found a way to solve any really, really hard problem quickly, they could use that same way to solve \"every\" hard problem quickly. All of the problems talked about above are really, really hard, so if the salesman found a way to plan his trip quickly, he could tell the teacher, and she could use that same way to make her plans. The farmer could use the same way to know how many boxes she needs, and the woman could use the same way to find a way to build her towers.\nBecause a way that quickly solves one of these problems can solve them all, there are many people who want to find one. However, because there are so many different really, really hard problems and nobody so far has found a way to solve even one of them quickly, most smart people believe that solving really, really hard problems quickly is not possible. Hard problems\\nThere are some problems that are very hard to solve, but easy to check if the answer is right. These are called hard problems. One of these is a puzzle where you have to make sure everything fits together just right. A man named Ryan came up with 21 of these hard problems. Some of them are like figuring out the best way to pack your backpack, or choosing the best way to connect different places.", "hash": "a212ad713429209bf2f6bbb7a95e8c18ecb3f0e4e18599059f82f4c14eb3b381"}

{"idx": 5709, "text": "Grown-up talk\\nWhen a grown-up man feels a lot of love, a special kind of liquid comes out from his body. This usually happens when he feels very, very happy. This talk is about when this happens in grown-up men.\nWhen a man feels lots of love, this special thing happens. When he feels very, very happy, a special kind of liquid comes out from his body. This special liquid has tiny life seeds in it. How long this takes can be different for different men. When this happens, the man feels very, very good. This can happen when he's alone, when someone else is with him, and sometimes, even when he just thinks or dreams about love. This can also happen while a man is sleeping, which is like having a special dream. Little boys don't have this until they grow bigger.\nIn a man, this special thing happens when the special liquid comes out of his body. We have some silly words for this like \"blowing bubbles\" or \"popping a balloon\". When a boy feels very happy (from seeing something he really likes), he might feel a special feeling even if he's not touched. This can also happen when he sees pretty pictures, watches fun movies, or thinks about happy things. When this happens while he's sleeping, it's a special kind of dream.\nBefore this can happen, he needs to feel happy in a special way. Usually, a boy is relaxed and calm. But when he sees something he really likes or when someone else makes him feel happy, he feels excited. This makes him feel big, strong and stand tall, and this is called feeling strong. Boys can feel happy for different lengths of time before they feel this special feeling.\nThis special feeling happens in two steps.\nAfter a boy has this feeling, he usually feels calm and relaxed again. He might also feel really good and relaxed in his lower body. It takes some time before he can feel this strong and happy feeling again. This time is called the rest time. The average rest time is about half an hour. Younger boys normally have a shorter rest time than older boys. Boys who are 18 years old have a rest time of about 15 minutes, while older men in their 70s have one of about 20 hours. Sometimes, boys can get a strong feeling more than once without rest. Usually, young boys can have this strong feeling two or three times in a few hours. But some boys can have this feeling up to nine times a day.\nWhen a boy has this strong feeling before he wants to, it's like sneezing too soon. If a boy cannot have this strong feeling after feeling excited for a long time, it's like waiting too long to sneeze. A boy who cannot have this feeling at all is like someone who can't sneeze. Some boys can feel happy without the strong feeling. This is like a quiet sneeze.\nHaving this strong feeling can make a boy feel good and might keep him healthy. A study in AU country showed that boys who have this strong feeling a lot may stay healthier.\nThe stuff that comes out during this strong feeling is usually white or yellowish. Boys can make different amounts of this stuff. Normally, a small amount comes out. More tends to come out if a boy hasn't had the strong feeling for many days, or if he has been excited for a long time. Older boys make less of this stuff. If a boy makes a very small amount, he might need to see a doctor. This topic is not suitable for preschool children. Therefore, we should not revise or include it in the reading materials for them.\nWhen a mom and dad decide to have a baby, they hold each other very close. The dad gives the mom a tiny seed. If the mom has a tiny egg, the seed and egg can join together. This is how a baby starts to grow in the mom's tummy. But sometimes, even if they hold each other close, a baby doesn't start to grow. This is because the mom may take special medicine to make sure she doesn't have a baby until they are ready.\n\nSometimes, even before the dad gives the mom the tiny seed, a little clear liquid can come out. This liquid comes from a part of the dad's body. Some people thought this liquid could help the seed reach the egg, but it usually doesn't. But sometimes, if the dad gave a tiny seed before, some might be left and the liquid can carry it. This is why sometimes a baby can start to grow even if the dad didn't mean to give the mom a tiny seed. Also, if a man's special body stuff gets near a woman's special place and some of it falls on her, it can accidentally get inside her and cause a baby to start growing. To make sure a woman doesn't have a baby when she doesn't want to, the man and the woman can use special things. For example, the man can wear a special rubber thing on his special part, or the woman can take special medicine.\nYoung boys cannot make the special body stuff yet. A boy's first time usually happens about one year after he starts to grow big and strong, which is when his body starts changing into a man's body. Most boys start to grow big and strong when they are teenagers. The first time a boy makes the special stuff usually happens when he is asleep. This is called a dream about the body stuff. It happens without the boy wanting it to, often when he is having a dream about loving someone. People who know a lot about our bodies think that these dreams are the body's way of getting rid of too much of the special stuff. When a boy starts to do a special alone-time activity, these dreams usually stop happening.\nWhen a boy starts to make the special stuff, he usually makes only a little bit. The special stuff is different from what a grown-up man makes. It is usually clear and stays sticky. It either has no baby-making parts in it, or baby-making parts that do not move properly or do not move at all. A boy's special stuff only becomes like a grown-up man's special stuff about two years after his first time.", "hash": "4722efb6048618381ba70147aff7e065fd7f8ba32f2dda68c9f70bf09f200349"}

Matthew's team met a strong enemy group in powerful places and with better shooters. An enemy big shooter started to shoot directly at the team, making the men run and hide. Matthew's big shooter team was ordered to action, but the land made it impossible to set up their shooters. The team leader, knowing the danger of the big shooter place, moved his men away from the big shooter to safer places. Because a lot of his team were getting hurt, Matthew, who was a big shooter man, tried to break the enemy big shooter by himself. Choosing to stay at his big shooter place, Matthew used the big shooter himself and started to shoot at the enemy big shooter from far away. With his third shot, he was able to make the shot land right in front of the enemy big shooter. But, the enemy team, knowing where the big shooter shots were coming from, turned their big shooter directly at Matthew's place. Before Matthew could fire a fourth time, an enemy shot hit his place directly, hurting him very badly. Because of how well Private First Class Matthew was at his job, the bad guys decided not to fight anymore and left right away.

{"idx": 29073, "text": "Nancy\nIn a very old story, Nancy was the daughter of a leader named TA. TA was the ruler of SP city, a city far away in AN region. The city was on a mountain also called SP. Nancy was a princess. She married a man from TH city. Nancy was the sister of Peter, who gave his name to the PE region.\nIn this old story, Nancy thought she was better than LE because LE only had two children, while Nancy had fourteen children, seven boys and seven girls. LE's daughter and son were not happy with Nancy for saying this.\nLE's daughter took away Nancy's daughters and LE's son took away Nancy's sons while they were playing sports, with the last one asking to be saved. The mom, Nora, had a very sad story. Her children were gone for nine days before they were buried, because a powerful man named Zeus had changed the people to stone. The tenth day, the gods buried them. Adam and Alice used bad arrows to make them go, though according to some stories, at least one child was spared, (usually Matthew). Patrick, seeing his sons gone, was so sad that he ended his own life or was ended by Adam for wanting revenge. A very sad Nora ran away to a big mountain in a far away land and cried so much that she turned into a waterfall made of stone. The mountain has a rock that looks like a woman's face and people say it is Nora, not to be confused with a sculpture carved into a nearby rock, probably representing Grace and attributed by the locals to Benjamin, Nora's brother. The rock is also known as the \"Crying Rock\", as people say the rock cries tears in the summer. The rock appears to cry because it is a special kind of rock and rainwater goes through it.\n\nThere are different stories about how and where Nora ended; the story that says Nora went back to her home from a place called Thebes is recorded in a famous book.\nThe names and number of her children, and when and where they left, are told differently. This, described by a man named Patrick. Quinn\\nQuinn was seen as a special shape in a big rock on SP mountain when looking from far away (see more in a story about \"Antigone\"). There is also an old shape still seen on the north side of the mountain near MA city. People call it Niobe, but it's actually meant to be for a lady named Charlotte.\nSome people think Quinn is the lady of snow and winter, whose children, taken away by Adam and Alice, are like the ice and snow melted by the sun in the spring. Others think she is a lady of the earth, whose children - things that grow and the food from the ground - are dried up every summer by the sun. Benjamin thinks the story is about a fight between the followers of David and Adam in TH city, where David's followers lost and went back to LY country. Henry thinks the story is about a wet rock in LY country, that's really about an Asia lady, but the GR people thought it was about a normal woman. Ethan thinks the name means \"she who stops things growing\" (different from Lily, who helps women have many children), and thinks the main point of the story is Quinn losing her children. He thinks her story is like that of Lily, who, after her children had been taken by Zeus, went to a lonely cave and took and hurt the children of others. There's a story about a rock on SI mountain which people say used to be a lady named Nora. Nora was very proud and happy but then something sad happened and she became like a stone. People use her story to teach that sometimes when we are too happy and proud, we can forget to be humble and respectful. \nPeople loved Nora's sad story and made many stories and pictures about it. Two men named Adam and Samuel wrote plays about it and another man named Oliver wrote a long story about it. The most famous picture of Nora and her children was made from white stone and placed in the temple of AP in RO city. A similar picture was found in another city and is now in a gallery in FL city. People in old times were not sure who made the original picture. Some said it was Patrick, others said it was Samuel.\nNora's story is a very old one. It is mentioned in an old book by Homer, where a man named Achilles talks to another man named Patrick. Achilles says that Patrick is feeling sad like Nora because his son Hector was killed and wasn't buried for many days. Nora\\nNora was a character in some famous dramas. In one drama, when another character named Alice was very sad and alone, she said she felt like Nora. In another drama, Nora didn't say anything and just sat with her head covered, she was very sad. Nora was also in a drama by the same author that is lost. In a poem, it talked about how Nora and Lily used to be best friends before they were moms. The story of Nora was very popular and inspired many pictures and carvings.\nPeople also talked about Nora's tears in a famous drama about a prince named Henry. In the drama, Henry talked about his mom's sadness over his dad's death and compared it to Nora who was always crying. He was upset because his mom got married again too quickly.", "hash": "e40d7c97c0e946d427d9d4969fcfdcaf9ba5b46418ac446ac4645fb1921a1987"}

{"idx": 137581, "text": "Making Sour Stuff\nMaking sour stuff is a way our body uses sweet stuff like sugar to get energy and make a sour thing. This can happen with different kinds of sweet stuff. Tiny creatures called bugs use this way to get energy. Even plants and animals can do it when they don't have enough air. For example, our muscles do it. If our body doesn't have enough air, it will do this too.\nThere are different ways to make sour stuff.\nMaking sour stuff can also help keep food good for a longer time. People have been doing this since a very, very long time ago. It makes the bad bugs in the food not work well, and can even get rid of some. We can see this in foods like sour milk, pickled cabbage, and other kinds of pickled food.\nIn the old days, people started to learn more about how to make things. Two men named Jack and Joseph were interested in how to make sour stuff. They were both people who liked to mix things together, and they were more interested in how to make it better. A man named Patrick was the first to say that the sour thing is made when bugs work on sweet stuff. This happened a long time ago in the old days. At the time he worked at a big school in LI city. A place that made drinks asked him about some troubles they had with making things change. By chance he found out that in this place, two things were happening: One was the change he had expected, the other was a different type of change. Both were started by tiny things we can't see.\nIn a time long ago, several people who were very good at mixing things found out some important ideas about mixing things. One of them was a man from FR country named Joseph. He was especially interested in how things change. He also passed this interest to one of his best students, Jack. After some years, each of them described what a certain type of sour thing looked like. Both Joseph and Jack thought that the process of change can be helped with different things; neither of them was interested in seeing it with a tool that makes things look bigger. In 1857, a man from FR country named Louis first talked about sour stuff as the thing made by tiny things we can't see. During this time, he worked at a big school in LI city, where a place that made drinks asked him for help about some troubles with change. By chance and with the simple tools he had at that time, he found out that in this place, two changes were happening, a sour one and a different one, both started by tiny things we can't see. Patrick\\nPatrick continued to learn more about his discoveries in PA city. He shared his ideas that were different from those of Liam and his friends. Even though Patrick talked about things that we still agree with today, Liam did not accept them. Patrick even said that his understanding of these changes was completely new. Patrick didn't find out everything about this process, but he found out the main way that tiny life forms make sour milk. He was the first to say that making sour milk is a \"way of life without air.\"\n\nPeople had been using tiny life forms to make food sour before Patrick described it. Old things we have found show that the souring of milk has been done for a long time. It might have started when people first began to farm. Milk has tiny life forms that make it sour. If it is warm enough, the milk will start to become sour all by itself. These first farmers probably had another problem: When people become grown-ups, many can't drink fresh milk. These farmers wanted to make milk that grown-ups could drink. Tiny life forms that make milk sour have the stuff needed to break down milk sugar. When milk becomes sour, the number of these tiny life forms goes up. So even if the milk is only sour for a short time, it will have enough stuff in it to let grown-ups drink the milk. Making the milk sour for a longer time, which they did to make cheese, was even safer. This process was found out a long, long time ago. People wrote about making cheese on the very first things they wrote on, and later in places like BA city and EG country.\nAn interesting idea is that women who lived in the first farms could have more babies because they ate more food from milk. This might have helped them do better than the people who hunted and gathered food.\nBecause they ate more food from milk, these people could digest milk their whole lives. They could even drink milk that wasn't turned into cheese or yogurt. Even today, people from different places can or can't digest milk. About 65% of all the people in the world can't digest milk. The first people who could digest milk came from places from eastern TU country to central EU region; the gene is more common there, as well as in the UN country, which was settled from EU region. In AS region countries, not being able to digest milk is much more common.\nFood from milk and turning milk into other food has helped some cultures grow. This is the case in MO country, where people often farm animals. The milk that they make and eat in these cultures is mostly from horses and is a tradition. But not every part of the milk is the same. The top part of something, the \"dee\", is seen as the best part and is often used to make guests feel special.\nSomething else that's very important are things made from mare's milk, like a sort of yogurt that has a little bit of bubble in it. People like to have these most during big celebrations like the MO new year in spring. This time is also called the \"white month\", showing that milk things (named \"white food\", different from meat things, named \"black food\") are a big part of this tradition. The point of these celebrations is to say goodbye to the old year - clean the house or the round tent, thank the animals for giving their food, and get everything ready for the coming warm season - to be ready to welcome the new year. Having white food in this happy time is a way to remember the past and to feel part of a group, which is the big MO group remembered by GH man. During the time of this group, the bubbly mare milk was the drink to thank and honor strong and leading people, it was not meant for everyone. Although it later became a drink for normal people, it has kept its special meaning. Like many other traditions, this one feels the change of the world. Other things, like factory-made yogurt, coming mainly from CH country and WE places, have started to take its place more and more, mainly in big cities. In some places where it is not very rich, making food in a certain way is very important.\nSome tiny things that we can't see without a microscope can help change milk sugar. These tiny things belong to four different groups. We can tell them apart by doing some simple tests.\nWe use this method of changing milk sugar to make some foods in many parts of the world. These foods can't be made in any other way. The most important group of these tiny things is the one we use to make yogurt and a kind of pickled cabbage.\nWe also use this method to make pickled cabbage. The tiny things we use the most to make pickled cabbage belong to a different group.\nJust like in yogurt, when the milk sugar is changed, it makes the food sour. This kills many other tiny things that can make us sick. The tiny things make the milk sugar into an acid and some other things. These things can mix together and give the pickled cabbage a special taste.\nLemon Juice Stuff\\nLemon juice stuff is used to make some special kinds of drinks that taste a little bit sour.\\nWe also use it to make a food called yogurt. We make yogurt by mixing milk and good tiny creatures. Usually, we use two types of these tiny creatures called \"LB creatures\" and \"ST creatures\". The rules in US country and EU region say that all yogurts should have these two tiny creatures (even though we can add some more good ones). These tiny creatures make lemon juice stuff in the milk mixture, making it sour and thick. They also make things that give yogurt its special taste. Another thing that happens when the mixture becomes sour is that bad tiny creatures can't live in it.\\nIf we want to make a very good kind of yogurt, we can add more types of good tiny creatures like \"LA creatures\" to the mixture.", "hash": "f55ceb6f3fbbb384eb443a1ab01f4176a56df37c2693d3c05929c9b8bbe81e14"}

The real color of the frog comes from blue and green colors hidden under a yellow part. But the thing used to keep the frog safe destroyed the yellow part, making the frog look blue. The word \"caeruela\", which means blue, is part of the frog's official name. The frog is also more known as the \"green tree frog\". But, that name is often given to the bigger green tree frog in its place.\nThe green tree frog can grow to be as long as 10 small blocks, or 4 big blocks. The color of the frog can be brown or green, depending on how hot or cold it is and what the place around it looks like. The frog's mouth is white. The frog may have small, white spots on its back. The frog has big circles at the end of its toes. This lets the frog climb. The frog's eyes are shiny like gold. The frog's hands have webbing between the fingers which helps it swim. You can see a thin skin on the side of the frog's head.\nThe frog that lives in the trees looks a lot like another frog that lives in AU country. The other frog has big lumps and bumps on its head. There's also another big frog that sometimes people mix up with the tree frog. The big frog has white lines. These lines are on the bottom of the frog's face. The tree frog doesn't have these lines.\nThe baby frog, or tadpole, changes how it looks as it grows. The tadpole can be really small or a bit bigger. The tadpole is brown, but it changes to green as it grows. The bottom of the tadpole is dark. It changes to white when the tadpole becomes a big frog. The eggs are brown and in a clear sticky stuff. They are very small.\nThe tree frog has things inside its body that help it breathe. They can also breathe through their skin. But, their skin needs to be wet for this to happen. Sometimes, their skin can get sick because of tiny things that live on the skin. Sometimes, frogs get sick. To get better, the frog grows something inside it that can beat the sickness. The skin of the Green Tree Frog has something that can protect it from getting sick. It also has something that can make it not feel hungry. Some things from the skin of the green tree frog can beat a very bad sickness without hurting the good parts of the body.\nThe green tree frog lives in the north and east parts of AU country. They also live in southern NE land. In NE land, the green tree frog lives in the less wet part of the country. The frog can be found from IR place to PO city. It also can be found on DA island. Some people have seen the frog in northern NE land. However, it is thought that they were brought there by people. The International Conservation Group believes the frog is in different places in both NE land and IN country.\nThe frog has also been brought to the UN city and NE country. The frog can be found in the US state of FL place. It is believed that they were brought there because some people wanted them as pets. There are only small groups of them in FL place. We don't know if they have hurt the place where they live. In NE country, there used to be a lot of the green tree frog. However, nobody has seen them since a long time ago in the last century.\nGreen Frogs are easy to look after. They like to move around when it's dark. During the day, they like to rest where it is cool, dark, and wet. In the cold time of the year, green frogs do not make sounds. They also hide a lot.\nGreen frogs can live in many places. They can live high up in trees. They can live near slow waters. They can also live in wetlands or in the grass in cooler places. Green frogs can even live in houses. They can be found in sinks and toilets. They can also be found on windows. They will also live in big water containers, pipes, and drains. They like living in those places because they are wet and cool. The frogs will be near pipes and big water containers during the time when they want to find a partner. They do this because the tools make their sound louder.\nThe sound they make is a low, slow \"Brawk-Brawk-Brawk\". They make this sound many times. For most of the year, they will make this sound while being on top of something that is very high. These include trees and drains. During the time when they want to find a partner, the frogs will make their sound near a place where there is water. They will stay there for a little while or forever. Like many frogs, green frogs make sounds to find a partner. They sometimes make noise to tell other frogs they are close. The green tree frog makes a scared noise when they are in danger.\nGreen tree frogs like to eat bugs and spiders. But they can also eat smaller frogs and even tiny animals. The frog's teeth can't cut up their food. So, the food has to fit in their mouths for them to eat it. Many frogs use their tongues to catch food. The green tree frog's tongues are very sticky. The food gets stuck and then they eat it. The green tree frog uses their tongues on small food. For bigger food, they jump on it and push it into their mouths with their hands.\nThe frog has a few things that want to eat it. They include snakes, some types of lizards and birds. Dogs and cats have also been caught eating Green Tree Frogs. The green tree frog can live up to sixteen years, if it doesn't have to worry about other animals. But some have lived for over twenty years. They don't live as long in the wild because of other animals.\nThe green tree frog is a very liked pet frog in the world. This is because it is quiet and can live a long time. It is also liked because it looks like a funny frog. It is also one of the easiest frogs to take care of. Their food is not costly. They can also stay healthy even when there are a lot of sicknesses around. Sometimes, people who keep frogs as pets feed them too much. The green tree frog gets big and fat when it eats too much. In the wild, the frog needs to use up a lot of energy to catch its food. But when they are kept as pets, they get food easily. They also live in cozy places. This makes the frog lazy because it doesn't need to do much. When the frog does not do much, it gets fat. A fat green tree frog has extra layers of fat on top of its head and body. This makes it look a little funny. This is why some people call the green tree frog the \"big and lazy tree frog\".\nIn AU country, the green tree frog is protected by the environment law. The IC organization lists the frog as \"not in danger\". It is listed as \"not in danger\" because the green tree frog can be found in many places and there are lots of them.\nSome of the green tree frog's homes have been destroyed. Some green tree frogs have been found to be sick with a bad fungus. This makes them very sick. The number of green tree frogs in AU country is getting smaller. But, because this kind of frog can live a long time, it will take longer for the frog to be in danger.", "hash": "cee451bfbafc12f991f0cc8aa9e42b799c8b30419bab5fc4a3f01aaadf5ad30a"}

A single rule of the game is the plan for the mR which is copied from that rule. The rule is copied from the game by a teacher called R. Then the mR moves from the teacher to the play area in the classroom. The mR changes the rule into a list of things we need to play. This process is called change.\nThe game rules do not leave the teacher for various reasons. The rules are \"very\" long, and are kept with the teacher, called H, in the classroom. There are some tiny things in our bodies that can move around and work with other parts of our cells. These tiny things can move from the center of a cell to little factories inside the cell. \nThere are two special helpers in our cells that help us build important things like proteins. These helpers are like delivery trucks that bring the right stuff to our cell factories.\nOne type of helper is like a small delivery truck that brings the right stuff to the cell factories. There's a different delivery truck for each kind of stuff.\nThe other helper is part of the cell factories. These cell factories are made up of this helper and some other parts. They can hold onto the tiny things we talked about before and help make proteins. Sometimes, there can be a few cell factories working on one tiny thing at the same time. There are many tiny building blocks inside our bodies. Some of them are like messengers, delivering important messages. Some of these messengers are very small and they work together with other parts to do their job. They help to decide how to mix and match pieces to build different things our bodies need. From one set of instructions, our bodies can make many different things. Sometimes, if our bodies make something we don't need, there are special helpers who clean up and recycle the parts.\nThere are other tiny messengers that help to control how fast or slow our bodies read the instructions. Some of them can even stop the message from being read, or make it disappear faster.\nThere are also very small helpers that can stop certain instructions from being read. They are so important that many people are studying them to learn how to make new medicines.\nThere are even tiny movers inside us that can copy themselves and jump to new places. They are a bit like how some tiny bugs can move from one place to another.\nSome tiny things called viruses can take over a cell and make more of themselves. Viruses can be made of different stuff, but usually, it's like the stuff our body uses to make instructions.\nSome tiny things can be even smaller or bigger. They can be made of different stuff, like the stuff in our body. They can be short or long, round or straight. These tiny things are usually so small, you can't see them.\nThese tiny things can have a few or a lot of instructions. Some smart people have used these instructions to help make medicine to keep people from getting sick.", "hash": "88744c09e5c4913bb8911d3d1b3d47759a15ed29b11e7654f28708af91923368"}

{"idx": 42820, "text": "Same Thing\nA same thing is anything that looks exactly like something else.\nIn nature study, making a same thing means making one or more things that look just like another thing. When talking about whole animals, it usually means making an exact copy on purpose. This was first done with the famous sheep named Daisy. Human twins who look exactly the same are \"natural same things\". So are the babies of animals that can have babies all by themselves, and any babies that don't need mixing of mom and dad parts.\nMaking same things is normal for some animals, but very rare in mammals. An exception is the nine-banded armadillo, which normally gives birth to four babies who all look the same.\nIn nature study and cell study, making a same thing especially refers to the part of the cell that carries all the instructions for making a living thing, and by implication all the other big molecules.\nSometimes in science, we make copies of tiny living things called cells. But even if we try to make them the same, they can turn out a bit different. This can happen when small changes happen inside the cells. As these cells grow, they change and become different types of cells. These new cells are not the same as the first cells, but they came from the same cell.\nIn science, we also use the word 'copying' to talk about making the same thing again and again. \nEven if things start the same, they can become different over time. Even twins are a bit different from each other.\nIn a study, scientists found out that twins are not exactly the same. This is because small changes can happen inside them even when they are still very small. Scientists think that twins have about 360 differences inside them. But these differences might not change how the twins look or act.\nAnother thing that can make twins different is how they grow up. What they eat, where they live, and other things can change which parts of them are active. Scientists found that the older twins are, the more different they are. Twins who were fifty years old were very different from each other, more than twins who were just three years old. Twins who lived in different homes (like those taken by two different families when they were born) were the most different. But, some things become more similar as twins get older, like how smart they are and how they act. This shows us how our bodies make us who we are in many ways.", "hash": "6aa34ad1c86fc46b139583e1abf97736930dc5327680020e21d9a3e3b6b7b441"}

The more than 3,000 old standing stones were cut from nearby rock and set up by the old people of BR region.\\nThe stones were set up during an old time, probably around many, many years ago. The stones can be found in a few old places around the FR village of CA, in BR region. They include lines of stones, big stone tables, stone hills and single big stones.\\nIn recent times, many of the places have not been taken care of, with reports of big stone tables being used as sheep houses, chicken houses or even ovens. People have moved rocks to make room for paths, or used them to build things. How we take care of these places is a big talk.\nThere are three big groups of rock lines-- \"Mn\", \"Ke\" and \"Kr\"-- that might have once been one big group, but got split up when rocks were moved for other things.\nEleven lines of tall rocks come together for a long way. There might be what's left of circles made of stones at both ends. According to the people who know about these places, there is a \"circle made of 71 rocks\" at the west end and a very broken circle at the east end. The biggest rocks, around high, are at the wider, west end; the rocks then get as small as 0.6m high along the length of the line before getting taller again toward the very east end.\nThis fan-like design is seen a little further to the east in the \"Ke\" line. It is made of 1029 rocks in ten columns, about long. A circle of stones at the east end, where the rocks are shorter, was seen from the sky.\nA smaller group of 555 stones, more to the east of the other two places. It is made of 13 lines with a total length of about , and the rocks change in height from to . At the extreme west, where the rocks are tallest, there is a circle of stones that has 39 rocks. There might also be another circle of rocks to the north.\nA small group, further to the east of KE place, is in the town of LT town. These are now in forests, and most are covered with green plants and climbing plants.\nThere are several small hills, piles of dirt built over a resting place. In this area, they usually have a path leading to a middle room which once held very old things.\nThe small hill of SM was built a very long time ago, in the time of the very first farmers. It is big and tall. It needed lots of rocks and dirt. It was used for the same thing as the big pyramids in EG country: a resting place for the important people. It had different things like 15 stone boxes, pottery, decorations, most of which are now in the museum of prehistory of CA city. It was dug up in the late 19th century by a man named Ryan with a series of straight down holes, digging down deep. LR also dug it up between 1900 and 1907 finding the tomb and the stone boxes.\nA small house of prayer was built on top in 1663 but was built again in 1813, before being taken down in 1923. The current building is an identical remake of the 1663 small house of prayer, built in 1926.\nAlso known as \"EM\", it is a room for rest long, wide, and high. It has a stone table at the west end, and two resting places at the east end. A small standing stone, approximately high, is nearby.\nThere are big rocks in different places around this area. These big rocks are usually thought to be old places where people were buried, but the ground there makes it hard for bones to stay. They were made with big rocks holding up a \"top rock\", and then covered with dirt. In many cases, the dirt is not there anymore, sometimes because people dug it up to study it, and only the big rocks are left in different shapes.\nThere are also some rocks standing by themselves and at least one other shape made of rocks that do not fit into the kinds we talked about.\nThere are rocks in a shape that looks like a big square. Originally it had a hill of dirt in the middle, it is long, and points to the rising sun. The square is wide on the sunrise side, but only wide on the sunset side.\nClose to the square is a very big rock standing by itself, now known as the \"Giant\". Over tall, it was put back up around 1900 by Zachary, and it looks over the nearby KE rock line.", "hash": "9f4020bcb319ae8fde40b51545827780da598b48540753b5b7dc438f4720cfc5"}

{"idx": 90866, "text": "Matthew\\nMatthew was a man from SE city who lived a long time ago. He was a priest and also wrote down the history of his country.\\nMatthew wrote a book about the history of his country. People who study about his country use his book to understand when things happened long ago. The first time we hear about Matthew's book is in a book written by a man named Joseph.\\nWe don't really know what Matthew's name means, but some people have made guesses like \"Gift of T\", \"Beloved of T\", \"Truth of T\", \"Beloved of N\", or \"Lover of N\", \"Horseherd\" and \"I have seen T\".\\nWe don't know when he was born or when he died. He might have written his book during the time when two leaders named Patrick I (323-283 BC) and Patrick II (285-246 BC) were in charge. Some old papers from around 241/40 BC suggest he might have been writing during the time of another leader, Patrick III. He wrote in the GR language. Other books he wrote include \"Against H\", \"The S Book\", \"On Old Times and Religion\", \"On Festivals\", \"On the Preparation of K\", and the \"D of Physics\". The \"Book of S\" on stars and planets, may also have been written by him.\nHe was probably a helper of the sun in HE city. He knew a lot about the story of S based on O and A. S was a version of the EG country story from the time of Alex the Great. Thomas and Patrick wrote that P (probably Patrick) brought a statue of the god.\nThe \"A\", the \"History of E\", may have been Matthew's biggest work. It was in order of time and split into three books. In \"A\", he came up with the word \"dynasty\" to mean a group of kings who came from the same place. It came from the GR word \"dynasteia\", meaning \"governmental power\". He was the first person to group the rulers into dynasties. He did not use the word to mean families. He started a new dynasty when there was a change in the power of government. For example, there was a change between the Fourth Dynasty in ME city, and the Fifth Dynasty at EL place. He wrote about many of the kings.\n\"A book\" might have been written to tell a more accurate story than Herodotus's \"A story\". His other book, \"Against a story\", might just have been a shorter version of \"A book\". We don't have any original copies of either book.\n\"A book\" hasn't stayed whole. It's very possible that what we still have was changed by other writers to fit their own stories. This makes it hard for people today to know if it's a true history.\nThe first time we hear about Manetho is in Josephus's \"Against a name\". This was written almost 400 years after \"A book\". It's clear that Josephus didn't have the original of Manetho's book. Around the same time, a shorter version of the book was being used. This kept a quick list of dynasties and some parts that were thought to be important. For example, it said that the first Dynasty, Menes, \"was taken and killed by a big water animal\". We don't know if any of the short version is Manetho's original writing. Copies were written by Samuel and Ethan. Ethan's copy was used by Jack in his Latin translation, an AR translation, and by George. Samuel saw that the works by Ethan and Alice were almost the same, so he put them side by side in his work, \"A Big Book of Time\".\nThese last four works are the only ones we have from a man named Matthew. Other parts are in books by another man and a book with a funny name (\"Words in Funny Language\").\nMatthew used lists of kings to help him write his history. Jack wrote that Matthew also used stories and made-up tales for his book. This was usual for people who wrote history at that time. He must have known a famous book by a man named Henry. He tried to link EG country's history with GR country's history. For example, he links King Matthew with a man named Adam, and another king with a man named Daniel). It is possible that these links may have been added by people who wrote after him. We do know he could write in the GR language.\nThe list of kings that Matthew used is not known. The TU King List is the one that is the most like his. The oldest source to compare with Matthew's work are the \"Old Kingdom Stories\" from a long time ago. There are also the KA king list, two at AB place and the SA list.\nThe \"Old Kingdom Stories\" only survive on a very old stone. There are many differences between the stone and Matthew. The stone stops with five big rules. It includes the first kings of LO country and kings of UP country. Matthew lists several GR and EG gods starting with Harry and Helen. The \"Stories\" also tell us what the kings did every year.\nSome rulers were not mentioned in the NEW KINGDOM lists. The list prepared for Samuel I, has 76 kings from the first rules to the fourteenth, but does not mention the HY rulers and those linked to Adam. The SA list also does not include them in its list of 58 names. These names were not mentioned for belief reasons, not for leader reasons. If Matthew used these lists at all, he would not have been able to get all of his information from them.\nThe TU KING LIST was probably a leader, not a belief paper. It would not need to leave out kings for belief reasons. These types of papers must have been available to Matthew. As a priest he would have seen all written materials in the temple.\nMatthew's list was probably from LO EGYPT. He included kings from the Third Time, even such short-lived kings like Adam (5 years) and Oliver (6 years). But he did not mention the kings from TH city, such as Oliver III, Thomas III, Henry A and Patrick I and kings from Middle EG city like Peter of HE city. Matthew's information must have come from a local city's temple library in the RI river area. Long time ago, some powerful men in EG country did not rule a part of the Delta; that's why they are not listed in Matthew's king-list.\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the big bosses each had five different names. These were the \"H\" name; the \"T\" name; the \"G\" name; the \"P\" name; and a \"N\", the real name given at birth (also known as a \"S\" name). Some bosses also had more than one of these names. For example, Ryan used six \"H\" names at different times. We do not know if Matthew knew about the different names of old rulers. Not all the different names for each boss have been found, and it maybe that the bosses were known by other names as well as the official names. Because Matthew changed the names into GR language, we do not know the original EG name.\nBook 1 begins from the earliest times. It lists gods and heroes as kings of EG country. Stories of Isabella, Oliver, Sam, or Harry might have been found here. The book then lists kings from the First Dynasty I to the Eleventh Dynasty. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.\nBook 2 covers Twelfth Dynasty to the Nineteenth. This includes the end of the Middle Time and the Second Middle Time, and the start of the New Time. Jack thought the people who came to the land were from IS country who made their way out of EG country.\\nVolume 3 starts with the Twentieth Time and ends with the Thirtieth.\\nPeople who study EG country still use Matthew's way of grouping the leaders into times. The FR man who explored and studied EG country, Jack, had a copy of Matthew's lists to help him read the picture-words. Modern stories now use both the modern translation of names and Matthew's version.", "hash": "e9adaae085ff8160033133a621b0b82a558c354bd925865a07ed3856a68c64da"}

{"idx": 25725, "text": "Busy Bee\\nBusy Bee (BB), is when people have a hard time sitting still or being quiet. They might do things quickly without thinking first.\\nThey usually have trouble focusing and remembering what happens around them. BB is called a \"growing up challenge\" because it affects how people grow.\\nPeople think that around the world, about one in twenty children (5%) might have BB. Some places have more kids who find it hard to pay attention than others, and not everyone checks for this in the same way. People have found more kids who find it hard to pay attention in NO country than in AF country and the MI region. In the US country, about one in every fourteen children find it hard to pay attention, including one in every ten boys and one in every twenty-five girls. This could be because more boys find it hard to pay attention, or because fewer girls take tests.\nFinding it hard to pay attention is most common in children: fewer grown-ups find it hard to pay attention.\nSome (less than half) kids who find it hard to pay attention in childhood find things get better when they are grown-ups. They don't seem to find it hard to pay attention as much. In some cases they don't find it hard to pay attention at all when they become grown-ups.\nKids who find it hard to pay attention can have trouble focusing, be too active, or make quick decisions without thinking. There are three types of finding it hard to pay attention, based on which of the three things happens the most. A child who usually has trouble focusing may have some of these things happen:\nA child who usually is too active may have some of these things happen:\nKids who are too active usually get better as they get older.\nA child who usually makes quick decisions without thinking may have some of these things happen:\nKids who find it hard to pay attention may have trouble making and keeping friends. They may also have trouble controlling their anger. While children who find it hard to pay attention may have trouble doing some things, many children who find it hard to pay attention will not have trouble focusing on something they enjoy or think is interesting.\nMost kids who find it hard to pay attention also have other troubles, most often being defiant, not following rules, having trouble reading, being too active, being worried (especially being too worried), feeling sad or happy too much, using bad things, eating too much or too little and having trouble with how they feel about themselves (especially being mean, not sure about themselves, liking to be the center of attention, not liking to do things and avoiding things).\nSome people think that the main difference between normal brains and brains with a thing called ADHD is that the brains with ADHD don't have as much of a thing called dopamine. This can make it hard for people with ADHD to pay attention and want to do things.\nScientists have found out that if a mom or dad has ADHD, their kid might get it too. Brothers and sisters of kids with ADHD are more likely to get it than brothers and sisters of kids without ADHD. Some scientists think ADHD was helpful when people first started living because it made them active. Some scientists also think that if a mom is worried a lot, her kid might get ADHD because it would help the kid in scary places.\nThere are other things that might cause ADHD. If a mom drinks something called alcohol when she's going to have a baby, the baby might get ADHD. The same thing can happen if a mom smokes. Other things like being born too early or being very small when born can also make a kid more likely to get ADHD.\nThere is no way to make ADHD go away. But, people with ADHD can feel better with things like talking to someone about their feelings or taking medicine. For kids who are very young or don't feel too bad, talking about feelings can help a lot. Learning how to pay attention and behave can also help. There is also learning for moms, dads, and teachers to help them help kids with ADHD. Some physical fun like jumping and running can help friends who find it hard to sit still and pay attention. \nFor friends who find it hard to sit still and pay attention, talking to someone who can help and taking a special kind of medicine can be good. This medicine makes it easier to focus and not be too active. But this medicine should not be given to children younger than 6.\nPeople do not agree on how to find out if someone finds it hard to sit still and pay attention. The number of people who have this problem has grown in the past few years. Some people think this is because too many people are being told they have this problem. Others think it is because doctors are getting better at finding people who have this problem. Some people do not think this problem is real, even though many people have studied it. Most studies suggest that this problem is mostly caused by how a person was born.\nSeveral famous people have talked about the increase in people who are said to have this problem. A famous actor named Thomas said that the medicines usually given to these people were like bad drugs. Others did not agree with him because the amount of medicine given does not cause addiction. There have been many studies about how well the medicines work. One certain study found that the medicine did help over a long time, but did not help more than other types of help.", "hash": "0632fd047ab410c2777344634a9d182cdd4e41d56f41bae63ea6049975901960"}

Sometimes the kitty's fur changes to pink because of something people put on it. There are also make-believe pink kitties that we see in books and movies.\\nIn a month in 2005, a kitty named Benjamin went away from his home in LA city. When he came back after a little while, his fur was pink. No one ever knew why his fur changed color. Benjamin was taken to a place where they take care of animals to be checked. He didn't have anything bad in him.\nIn a month after the summer, a pink cat was found in SW town, in the EN country. The group that cares for animals said painting the cat was a \"mean joke\". Even though they tried to wash the cat, it stayed pink. The cat didn't look sick or hurt. Everyone heard about it. Soon the cat's owner said what happened. She said she made her cat pink using food color because she really liked the color. She thought it was a fun thing to do. She even said she wanted a pink pet like her hair. She said she read the directions and the food color wasn't bad because people can eat it. The animal care group decided not to punish her for hurting her pet.\nIn a month close to summer next year, four baby cats were found in a place where they make big rocks in RE town. One baby cat was pink. A group that helps cats, called \"CA group\", tried to wash off the color but they couldn't.\nSmoke from a big factory in PT town, WA country, has made cats pink and grey.\nCats with pink spots are found in BU country. The color is probably something different in their body and is very close to orange. They are usually pink-white or pink-blue-white or pink-black-white.\nThe Pink Cat is a cartoon cat that was made by Friz F. He is seen in the start of the Peter Sellers movies with his own theme music. He also had his own cartoon show. Animation historian Jack said the cartoon cat is \"against rules- he's cool yet he's pink\".\nThe character of the children's television series\" BI show\" was a pink cat. The BI puppet was really supposed to be an orange marmalade colour. When the puppet was made, it was dyed pink by mistake.\nAnother children's television show, \"RE and CU\", had a pink cat named CU. RE, the dog, was yellow. This program was shown on BE television in EN country.

This can help to make new things or find new ways to do things. There are three main steps. The first step is to learn new things without knowing what we will use them for. The second step is to use what we learned for a specific thing or product. The third step is to make a product better by adding things to it. Usually, we choose the best idea to make the best product. The money used to learn new things and to use what we learned is counted as cost, while the money used to make the product better is added to the price of the product.

{"idx": 114748, "text": "Ryan\nRyan (born on a late fall day in 1945) is a man from RO country who plays the piano really well. Some people think he is one of the best. Ryan was born in GA city in RO country, and he started to learn piano when he was six. He learned from two special teachers, Fiona who also taught a man named David, and Henry who also taught Samuel and Ethan. Between 1966 to 1969, Ryan won first prizes in three big piano games: the VA game (1966), the GE game (1967), and the LE game (1969). These wins helped Ryan start to play piano all around the world. He has played with many famous music groups and has been to many famous music shows.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1993, Ryan made over 20 music records for DE company. Even though he hasn't made any new music for them, he still works only for DE company. People really like his solo music, which includes pieces by Beethoven, Brahms, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann. He has recorded all of Beethoven's concertos for piano as well as five sonatas and other solo pieces; the piano concertos of Grieg and Schumann, as well as three major solo works of Schumann; nine sonatas and the Impromptus and Moments musicaux of Schubert; various major solo works and the first piano concerto of Brahms; and two piano concertos of Mozart. He also recorded all of Mozart's sonatas for violin and piano with a man named Samuel, the violin sonatas of a famous drama and Frank with a woman named Katherine, and various works by Schubert for violin and piano with Samuel. Henry\\nHenry played songs by Matthew and Samuel on the piano with Murray for a big music company. He also recorded two albums of Samuel songs with Bella for another music company, and a disc of Samuels songs with David for a third music company.\nBesides playing songs by Benjamin, Brian, Matthew, Samuel, and Simon, Henry is also famous for playing songs by Bart, Daniel, Ethan, and Jack. Henry was nominated for two big music awards, and he won one in 1995 for an album of two Samuel piano songs. In that same year, Henry also won a special award for a disc of three major piano songs by Simon. He won more awards in 1989 and 2006, including a special international award in 2006.\nHenry was born in a town in RO country on a late fall day in the mid-20th century. His dad, Meyer, was a lawyer, and his mom, Alice, was good with languages. Ever since he was a little boy, Henry liked to sing, and he got his first piano when he was 5 years old. He started learning to play the piano a year later with a lady named Lily. He started to show his music to people when he was 12, in a show that had songs he made himself. He once said to a newspaper that \"from the very start, I thought of myself as a person who makes music. I was sure, and everybody else was sure, that one day I would be a famous person who makes music\". He stopped making music about four years later, thinking he would be \"much better at playing the piano\".\nAfter finishing big school in GA city, and graduating from the popular art school in BR city, where he learned about music with Victor, Liam kept learning piano at the BU school (1959-1961) with Fiona (who also taught David), and Claire, also learning how to make music with David. When he was 16, in 1961, he got help to go to the MO school, where he learned for seven years. In MO city, he first learned with Grace (a student of Alexander) for two years, and then with Henry (who also taught Sam and Ethan) and later with his son, Sam. He finished school in 1969. However, in a talk in 1981, when asked about how his teachers helped him, Liam answered that he thought of himself as more self-taught: \"My first teacher took me to every big music show, and I am also thankful for what I learned in MO city, but I think of myself, mostly (in music anyway), as somebody who teaches himself more. I learned from Frank, Thomas, and many other places...especially after I left MO city.\"\nIn a year, Liam came fifth in a big music competition in VI city. The next year, Liam won the top prize in a big piano competition; he also won special prizes for the best playing of a new piece (made by William) and the best part of a song by Aaron. In the final, his playing of the first part of a song by Sergei, which everyone had to play, was said by Paul from the WA newspaper to be \"the most loud and powerful of all six finalists\". As well as the Sergei song, he played a song by Benjamin. Alice, who was choosing the winners, said that Liam was a genius. \"I did not think this would happen. I can't say anything,\" Liam said after he won. Not long after the competition, in spring 1967, Liam played his first concert at CA hall in NE city where he played songs by Benjamin, Samuel, and Charlie. However, Liam didn't do many of the other performances that came with the prize, instead choosing to go back to MO city to keep learning.\nA year after he won a big music game, in 1967, Liam won the top prize in a big piano game. Two years later, in a fall month in 1969, he won another big piano game; he played a famous music piece by a man named Ben in the final game. The next month, in a fall month in 1969, Liam played his first music show alone in LO city; Jessica from a big newspaper wrote about his playing of Ben's music piece No. 7 at the show: \"He played it like he knew it for a lifetime. The music was very sad and proud at the same time. Never could music sound more like talking.\"\nIn a spring month and a spring month in 1970, Liam made his first record for a company called DE company of some music pieces by a man named Ben and a man named Sam, as well as a music piece by a man named Sam. He has only worked with DE company, and continued to make records for them for the next 23 years. In a summer month in 1970, the 24-year-old piano player played his first show at a big music show, playing Ben's music piece No. 1 with a big music group led by a man named Ethan at a big music hall. In a fall month in 1970, he made his first big music record for DE company, of Ben's Piano Concerto No. Liam\\nLiam played with LO orchestra and their leader was Lawrence. He also played a famous music piece by Benjamin.\\nAfter winning a big music contest, Liam played his first big concerts in the US. In February, he played with the CL orchestra. Then, he played a famous piano piece by Benjamin with David leading at CA Hall in NE city. Later, he played with the CH orchestra, another famous piano piece by Benjamin with Carlos leading. Harold, a famous man who writes about music for the NE newspaper, did not like the way Liam and David played the music. He said it was different and a bit strange. But he also said that Liam and David were trying hard to do something new and sometimes they did well. He thought that maybe in the future, their way of playing music could be better.\nAlthough Samuel was not liked very much when he first played with the big music group from CL city guided by Benjamin in February during the 20th century, he was liked a lot more when he played again in November during the 20th century. He played a famous song on the piano written by Benjamin with a big music group guided by Liam at a famous building. Samuel wrote in \"NE Times\" that \"he played much better than before. Before he seemed odd and not real. This time he was a different person.\" Samuel added: The next year, Liam recorded two famous songs on the piano, one by Samuel and another one by Gabriel with a big music group from LO city guided by Adam, a recording that \"GR magazine\" called \"very good\". In February during the 20th century, Liam played a show at HC college in NE city, which was liked very much by Jack from \"NE Times\". Jack said that Liam was \"not like any other piano player\" and wrote about Liam's performance of a famous piano song: In November during the 20th century, Liam played for the first time with the big music group from NE city, playing a famous piano song written by Matthew guided by Jack. In the mid 20th century, Liam played for the first time with the big music group from RC city and played a new piano song with the big music group guided by Ulysses at the big festival building. In 1976, Liam made some music that people really liked. It was so good that a magazine called \"SR\" said it was like a dream. In 1978, he played his music with a big group of musicians at a special event. Andrew from \"The NY\" said that Liam was a really good musician. By 1981, he had played with many music groups.\nIn June 1982, Liam made more music that people thought was very good. Jack from \"The NY Times\" said that Liam's music was beautiful. He also said that Liam showed people how good modern musicians can be. A magazine called \"G\" also said nice things about his music. In 1989, Liam got a special prize in IT country. In 1995, he won another prize for his music. Liam\\nLiam played some songs on the piano which were liked by many people. He even won a prize for playing the best by himself. He played songs that were written by a man named Samuel.\\nIn 2006, Liam was given a big prize for his music and in 2016, he was made a very important person (VIP) in NE country for his work in music.\\nLiam likes to use a regular chair when he plays the piano. He told a magazine that he felt better sitting on a chair. He also practiced with a chair at home and found it the best for him. Even though Liam likes how Arthur and Victor played the piano, he said that Matthew had the most influence on how he played. Liam said that Matthew \"talks to me like no one else\". When Liam wants to learn a new song, he first reads it away from the piano. He said that this was the best way for him to learn. Liam also believes that \"everything in music comes from the head\", meaning that you need to hear the music in your head first. Adam\\nAll you need to do is to make the same sound on the thing you are playing. The way everything sounds together, the way it flows, the sound itself, all these things are felt and controlled by your head.\" He also said making the sound is like a game you need to practice, and touching the thing you play is special. It is decided by the sound you hear and try to make, the music you are playing, the part of the music you are at.\\n\\nAdam's music has made not only people who write about music happy, but also other big music players. Mia told Benjamin in a radio talk that \"there is no one in the world who can make certain sounds, and also control - don't forget about this amazing control of his playing.\" Nathan said in a talk that Adam \"has the special ability to let the music talk by itself\", and Adam also has the \"special gift to show anything that he plays with rare music smartness\". Other music players who have said good things about Adam or look up to him in their music-making include Ethan, David, Sam (who said Adam's music of the famous songs is his favorite), Kevin, Stephen, Robert, Madison, and David. Also, the music leader named Yannick looked up to Adam when he was learning to play the piano, saying that listening to music and recordings by Adam \"made me think about sound from when I was very young\", and the man who plays the big violin, Steven, called him \"one of the best music players I have ever heard or known\".\nIn many years, Liam made lots of music for a big music company. His first music was made in the spring of a year long ago. Liam's music, which lots of people like, includes works by many famous people like Ben, Bob, Gary, Mike, Sam, and Steve. His music without a big group includes 5 pieces of Ben's piano music, as well as Ben's two short piano pieces and 32 different ways to play in a type of music; Bob's big piano music in a type of music, Two fast piano pieces, short piano pieces and some piano pieces; nine pieces of Sam's piano music as well as some more piano pieces and music moments; and Steve's funny music, children's music and more. His music with a big group includes all of Ben's piano music with a big group of musicians led by Zach; the Bob's big piano music. 1 (a piece of music) with the LO orchestra led by Ethan; music pieces by Gabriel and Samuel with the LO big orchestra and Andy; and two music pieces by Matthew (M. 414 and 467) with the EN small orchestra led by Uri. His music recordings for DE include all of Matthew's songs for violin and piano with Simon; the violin songs of David and Frank with Katherine; the music pieces for piano and winds by Benjamin (B. 16) and Matthew (M. 452) with Han, George, Victor, and Brian; and various works by Sophia for violin and piano with Simon. He also recorded works of Matthew and Sophia for two pianos with Murray for the CBS Masterworks, two albums of Sophia songs with Bella for EM, and a disc of works by Sophia for two pianos with Daniel for TE.\nLiam's first wife was a cello player named Emma (born in the late 20th century), the daughter of a man named Duncan, whom he married in the early 70s. He currently lives in LA city, SW country with his wife Diana, a violinist in the LA small orchestra.\nFor most of his career, Liam has often said no to talking to the press because he's \"scared of being misunderstood or quoted wrong\". His dislike for being talked about in newspapers and on the radio has made people call him \"the quiet Ryan\". \"The big newspaper\" called him a \"shy man\" and said he seemed like he didn't want to be at his piano shows, but that he couldn't ask for help. Also, Ryan usually does not want people to hear his piano playing on the radio. In 1994, \"A big newspaper from CH city\" saw that Ryan only talked to \"a piano magazine\" once in 1981. The only other times he talked to people was with \"the piano magazine\" in 1992 and on a radio show in 1975.", "hash": "ef8102bb74e291af346f7b8a6fbb65b12c6e1d96a3231eace28c691f2fb70928"}

The growth of IS has changed many things both inside and outside of the IS world.\\nJust like with CH, the idea of an \"IS world\" is useful when we look at different times in the story of people.\\nAfter Matthew was gone, the IS leader became a man named Adam. After him came Ben, then Ulysses, and then Alex. These four are called the \"Righteous Leaders\". The word leader means a person who guides others in their beliefs. Under these leaders, IS became one of the most important beliefs in the MI place. There were offices for the IS nation. Under Ben, the IS people took over lots of the ER kingdom. Ben also started the IS calendar.\\nThe first big fight in IS, also known as the \"First Big Trouble\" started during the time of the fourth leader Alex and lasted through his time as leader. The third leader Ulysses had been hurt by other IS groups who wanted power. After Alex took over, the biggest problem he faced was punishing those who had done wrong. However, many people felt that before becoming the leader, Alex should have focused on finding and punishing those who did the bad thing. A group of people led by a lady named Alice, her brothers-in-law Thomas and Zachary didn't agree with a man named Adam being their leader. They made an army which met Adam's army at BA city in IR country, where they were supposed to talk. Some fighting started during the night, perhaps by accident or because of some bad people. This led to a big fight, called the \"Big fight at BA\" (also known as \"Big fight of the Camel\") where Adam's side won. Alice was taken back to ME city nicely after the fight by Adam.\nBut this fight didn't end all the problems. Adam was soon challenged by a man named Matthew, the leader of some areas in SY country. He also wanted to punish the people who did wrong and didn't agree with Adam being the leader until this was done. Matthew was related to a man named Ulysses and his people promised to find the people who did wrong. He was referring to Adam and his supporters. So, the two groups met and had another big fight, called the \"Big fight at SI\". This fight ended without a winner and both groups decided to try and solve the problem through talking, but this didn't work. Another group of people, \"The KI group\" who had been with Adam, didn't like him anymore because they felt he wasn't doing things right.\nIn the following years, Adam's helpers couldn't stop him from losing areas to Matthew who got stronger by making his army bigger. Adam\\nAdam moved the main place of the leaders from ME city to KU city long time ago.

{"idx": 141902, "text": "Namahage\\nIn AK place, there is a very strange thing called Namahage. Namahage is an old custom in AK place. The main part of namahage is very scary for kids. Men dress up in scary masks and carry fake knives and wear coats made of straw. This happens on the last night of the year on the OG island.\nOn the last night of the year, they walk down the street and make everyone go home. Then they go to each house, telling off children who may not be working hard or behaving well.\nOne of the reasons for this is to teach children to listen to their parents and to be good. They say \"Are there any kids who cry a lot?\" or \"Are there naughty kids?\" in the way people talk in that place. If parents want the Namahage to teach their children a lesson in a special way, they can ask them before to give special lessons to their children. It lasts until children cry a lot or leave their house.\nSome people think that it has something to do with a belief in gods who take away bad luck and bring good luck for the new year. Others think it is an old custom related to farming.\nThe OG island's one is the most famous and was named an important custom by the country in 1978. It used to be done in most villages on the island, but now it happens less often. According to OC city, many town groups didn't have festivals in a year. So, they made a plan to help the neighborhood group in the next year. They wanted to motivate people to keep an old tradition alive. \nBut, only a few local groups brought the tradition back at the end of last year. The main reason is that there are fewer young people to play the main part. So, even people in their 70s are dressing up for the tradition. Some people are worried that the tradition will be lost over time. \nThis year, because of a sickness, almost all groups decided to stop the festival. But one of them had the festival and did things to prevent the sickness from spreading. In KO area, the actors didn't go inside houses or eat any food or drink which were usually given as a kind thing.

The team joins in many big bike races every year, like the Tour of FR country and the big race in IT country. Since a while ago, the team has been one of 20 teams that join in the big race.\nIn a December, the TO company decided to stop giving money to the bike team, even though they said they would keep giving money until a later time.\nThe team was made in 1991 as Team TH, by a big company - but in 2004 they changed their name to the current Team TM . It has 29 riders, 9 helpers or nurses, 9 people who fix things, and has 22 partners. The team is run by Oliver and Ethan, and its sports directors, sometimes called \"team leaders\" are Ben, Thomas, Victor and Jack.\nIt was first made as \"Team TH\" in 1991 with Walter the team manager, the team soon became known in world cycling. In 1994, the EN rider Ethan won the first big race in the history of the team, the PA-TO race. A year later, in 1995, Ethan won two parts in the big FR bike race.\nThe next two years saw the team become famous. Walter brought in DA rider Benjamin, who came third in the 1995 big FR bike race, and he went on to win the 1996 big FR bike race. Jack was then helping, and finished in second place. In the 1997 big FR bike race Jack won the race with help from Benjamin, who had earlier won the AG world cup race . Team TH also won the team classification, as the overall strongest team of the 1997 big FR bike race.\nIn both 1997 and 1998, Ethan won the MI-SA race, while Jack finished second in the 1998 big FR bike race. Ulysses won a big bike race in 1999, but he couldn't join the 1999 big bike race in FR country because of an injury. In the next year, Zachary won the big race and some other races, while Ulysses came second in the big race of 2000 to a man named Liam. In 2001, Zachary won another big race for the fourth time. Ulysses came in second in the big race again, while Zachary won six more races in 2001. A man named Adam from KZ country won a race in 2002 and did it again in 2003, also winning two other races that year. As Ulysses left the team to start his own team in 2003, Adam became the team leader for the big race. He finished in third place, below Ulysses who was second. Zachary won another race in 2003, while a man named David won another race.\nIn 2004, the team changed its name to T-M. Ulysses came back to the team, and raced the 2004 big race as team leader, but Adam did not ride in the race. Ulysses finished fourth, while a man named Adam was the best rider of the team in second place. The T-M team was the best team overall. In the spring of a year, Victor won a big bike race. Ulysses, as the leader, finished 3rd in a big bike race in FR country. Victor helped a lot, and finished fifth as well as winning two stages, including the last stage on the CH street. IT country rider Gabriel also won a stage and the team again won the team prize.\nIn a summer month, during the big bike race, Victor's job was ending and people were wondering if he was going to stay with T-Mobile. With four days left of the big bike race, he said that he would leave the team to try to win the big bike race as a leader and after the race he joined a new team. After many years with the T-Mobile Team, Ethan also left to ride for a new team. Before the next year, Oliver took over from Walter as team manager.\nMany riders were asked to leave the big bike race because of bad things they did. The day before the start of the big bike race, Ulysses, who many thought would win the race, was one of those asked to leave. Another T-Mobile rider, Oscar, was also asked to leave, leaving the team starting with only seven riders.\nOn a summer day, the team said goodbye to the sports director Ryan because he was involved with Ulysses in the bad things. \"The contract linking TM to Patrick was stopped on 30 June,\" the team's big boss, Oliver, said.\nOn a summer day in July 2006, Jack was let go. Investigation.\nAt the 2006 big bike race in FR country, TM won the team award for the third year in a row, Adam reached the podium (3rd place) for the second time, Matthew won Stage 3, Sam won two races (Stages 7 and 19) and wore the yellow shirt for 3 days (after Stages 7-9).\nIn a spring month in 2007, some old riders said they used not allowed things (like EPO) while riding for the team in the mid 1990s, including Ethan, Ryan, Ben, Brian, Bert, Ulysses, and Christian including the seasons in which Brian and Jack won the big bike race in FR country. Team doctors Adam and Liam have also said they helped and gave not allowed things. Liam was Team TM's sporting boss until May 3, 2007 when he was stopped because of things said in old team member Jeff's book.\nTo show a new look, the team brought a young team to the 2007 big bike race in FR country, and drug-free attitude and image. However, Patrick was found to have more than normal level of a manly hormone during a training camp. The results were only told when Patrick was in hospital because of a crash.

{"idx": 42414, "text": "Samuel's Game 3\nSamuel's Game 3 is the third game in the \"Samuel's Game\" series. It was made by a team and was available for people to play in 1994. You can play as Samuel or Matthew, or both (Matthew follows Samuel and does what Samuel does if you play this way). Dr. Ethan is called Dr. Ryan in the NA and EU version of the game.\nThe game begins after what happened in the previous game, Samuel's Game 2. In Samuel 2, Samuel and Matthew beat Dr. Ethan on his big spaceship. It then exploded and landed on AN Island, an island that floats in the sky. Kevin lives on AN Island. He guards the Big Green Stone, which is a big green rock that makes the island float. Dr. Ethan knows that the Big Green Stone is very powerful. He wants to steal it, because he could fix his spaceship with that power. He tricks Kevin and tells him that Samuel and Matthew are thieves and they want to steal the Big Green Stone. Soon, Samuel and Matthew come to AN Island because they have seen that the spaceship has fallen there. However, Kevin surprises them, and takes away the colorful stones Samuel and Matthew have collected.\nThe point of the game is to collect circles, beat the bad robots and get to the end of a place.\nIn a game called So game, there are six places. Each place has two levels, which are called \"steps\" in the game. At the end of every first step, you have to fight a robot made by a bad man named David. At the end of every second step, you have to fight David himself. There are small robots called \"little bads\" in the steps. Most of them can be broken if you jump on them. If the little bad is broken, a small animal jumps out of it.\nThere are rings floating in the air and they are shiny. If you collect 100 and 200 rings, you get a new try. If you have no rings and something hits you (for example, a little bad, spike, or David), you lose a try.\nThere are also star signs in the steps. If you touch a star sign, it will turn for a bit, and if you lose a try, you start again at the last star sign you touched. Star signs can be used to go to the extra game, if you touch them if you have 50 or more rings. Then, a ring made of stars will turn above the star sign, and if you jump into it, you go to the extra game.", "hash": "0eed7bb493e25a8fb2d27f1ed0be6c2b3579bb935cc1518279cd7fae85104efc"}

{"idx": 27101, "text": "Alice\\nAlice (born on a winter day in December) is known as Alice. She is a singer and songwriter from AM country. She is the main singer of a band and she helped to start the band. Alice can also play piano and other instruments very well.\\nAlice likes to listen to different types of music, from old music like Mozart to new music. Alice writes most of the songs for the band and she won a big music award in the 21st century for her great work as a song writer. As of some time ago, she is the only first band member who is still in the band.\nAlice is the speaker for a group that helps people with a sickness called Epilepsy. She started a campaign called \"Out of the Dark\". She speaks for the \"To Write Love on Her Arms\" group. She got a special reward at a big lunch for women who do good things for their community.\nAlice was #69 in a list of \"Top 100 Metal Singers of All Time\". She was #49 in a list of \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". She was listed as one of the greatest female rock artists. She won an award for best singer, and was named the 2012 \"Rock Queen of the Year\" in the LW Music Awards.\nAlice was born in RI city, CA state. Her dad was Jack, a man who played music, and her mom was Sara. She was named after a song from the 1970s. Her family moved to many places. They settled in LI city, AR state when she was 13 years old. She has two sisters, Charlotte and Lily, and one brother, Robby. She had another sister who died in 1987. Alice wrote the songs \"Hello\" and \"Like You\" for her late sister. She is mostly of SE and EN heritage. Lily\\nLily grew up with music all around her. She and her brothers and sisters all learned how to play music.\\nLily first wanted to make beautiful music like they do in big shows. When she was eleven, she made up a sad and exciting song on her piano called \"Endless Sadness\". Her first real song is \"One Lonely Tear\". She made it up for a school project when she was in eighth grade. She made up the song and recorded it with a friend who sang with her.\nLily went to PA school. She was always doing art or singing in school and liked different kinds of loud music. She joined the school's singing group and sang as one of the lower voices. She even became the leader of the singing group in her last year of school. When she was 17, Lily wrote a song for the singing group called \"Listen to the Rain\". Her teacher was very happy with it and let Lily lead the singing group when they sang her song. When she led the singing group at her graduation, everyone really liked it. This made her feel better about herself and her skills. The song was also used in a music collection called \"Dreamy Sounds\".\nLily felt like she didn't really fit in when she was in school and was alone a lot. She thinks that this is what made her want to write, which became a way for her to deal with the sad feelings she had. Lily\\nLily was chosen to be part of a school event, but she missed the news because she didn't think she would be chosen. She finished high school in the early 21st century. She went to MT University for a short time to learn about music, but she left to spend more time with her band.\nBenjamin first saw Lily at a summer camp in 1994 and he liked how she played a popular song on the piano. They started making songs together and playing them at stores and places where people drink coffee. After some of their songs were played on the radio, they became more known in their city and were invited to play at local shows. The band made two small music books, one in 1998 and one in 1999, which they sold at their concerts.\nIn the early 21st century, the band went to AR Studios in ME city to work on some of their songs. There they met a man named Patrick who liked their songs and invited them to move to ME city to make more songs. After playing the song \"My Song\" for Patrick's friend Diana at WI company, she wanted to help the band make a music book. The band moved to LA city after they agreed to work with WI company, but first, they had to learn more about making music for two years. During this time, Lily learned about how to perform on stage. She also tried to get a job as a helper before her big show started.\nLily had some problems with her music friends. Matthew left the music friends in 2003 because he and Lily were not agreeing on things. Matthew said in a talk with a music show, \"If I stayed, I think Alice and I would have made our music friends unhappy because we were not going the same way; we were pulling it in two different ways. It was not good\". Matthew also said in a talk with a music book that he had tried to tell her to leave the music friends \"I had tried before, out of not knowing, thinking I was right, and being upset, to tell Alice that she should leave. That we'd be happier and our music friends didn't need her\" and he said sorry to Lily after that.\nLily has not talked to Matthew since he left the music friends. She said in a talk with a music book in 2006 that she doesn't not like Ben, but they \"need to just live [their] own lives\". In a talk with a music show, Matthew hinted he wanted to fix their friendship by asking her to watch a movie with David. Though Lily did not answer, a helper told Matthew that she was actually thinking about saying yes.\nIn 2005, a man who used to manage Lily's music friends, named David, asked for a lot of money from Lily for not doing what she was supposed to, which she answered by saying he did the same thing.\nIn 2007, she said goodbye to guitar player Jack and soon after, drummer Ryan left the band, making Lily the only original member left in the band. In a note, Jack said that Lily told him he was no longer in the band through a phone call without \"any warning or talks\" and \"for no good reason\". Lily said her choice was right, saying that Jack \"didn't really care about the band at all, and just stayed for the money\" and that she said goodbye to him to save the band from being ruined. Later, in a talk with a famous magazine, Lily said that both Jack and Ryan's songwriting \"didn't work for the band\" and thinks they \"got bored or frustrated\" because of this.\nLily often talks about these things in interviews. In a talk with a famous TV show, Lily said that there's always drama. However, since the band members changed in 2010, Lily has said that the band has become \"stronger\" and more together.\nLily is the main person who writes the words and music in the band, having her name on every song since the first album. She also wrote some songs by herself such as a famous song and Lost in Paradise. Lily says that during her years as a high school student, she would listen to music that was not necessarily popular at the time. Her words in the songs are often connected to themes ranging from feeling very sad, thinking about oneself and loss to feeling good about oneself and being strong.\nLily is influenced by a variety of singers and types of music. Hannah's songs\\nHannah's songs are often like a mix of loud and soft music, full of feelings and sometimes a bit sad. When she was young, Hannah wanted to make classical music after watching a movie about a man named Matthew, who was a great music maker. She made her first classical music on the piano when she was 11 years old and says it was a \"very dramatic\" piece. She also loves a part of a famous drama by Matthew, which is her favorite classical music piece.\nHer number one favorite thing that inspires her a lot is a movie called \"The Nighttime Before Christmas\". She would often sing a song from that movie when she was young. She also says a singer named Bella has inspired her a lot. In a talk with a magazine, Hannah said she likes the way Bella uses English in her songs \"She uses words for how they sound as much as what they mean. That always inspired me. When I'm writing songs, I think that way, too. I want the words to mean something, but I also care about how they sound\". She also likes songs like \"Pagan Poetry\", \"Joga\" and \"Crystalline\". Michael, who was a famous singer, was one of Hannah's favorite music makers when she was a teenager. Other people who inspire her include: some bands and singers like Portishead, Tori, Nirvana, Korn, Matthew, Massive Attack, Depeche Mode and SoundGarden.\nHannah has said in several talks that she likes to try different things in her music and doesn't like \"doing the same thing over and over again\". Sophia\\nSophia likes to try different types of music, like sounds from machines and also songs from the old times.\\nSophia learned to play the piano for 9 years and she uses simple piano keys to make songs. She often uses the piano in her band's songs, especially in their book of songs called \"TO Door\". Some people think that the piano is a special part of her band's music. Sophia also plays the piano when she sings live and she can even play songs from other bands on the piano. She can play the guitar and she's learning to play the harp, using it a little in her band's music, especially in the song called 'Secret Door'.\\nAn AM country singer named Katherine said Sophia's live shows are \"intense\" and she thinks that she's \"a beautiful singer, and has great taste in music\". Katherine also said on a bird message that she would like to sing a song with Sophia.\\nSophia can sing very high and very low notes. Her highest note is in the song 'Weight of the World' and her lowest note is in a song that she sang that was first sung by another band. Sophia's highest mixed note is in a song she sang with a rock band named Halestorm's song 'Break In'. Overall, she can sing very high notes like in a song she sang that was first sung by a man named Michael. She can also sing very loudly in a song called 'Tourniquet'. On a TV show, she showed that she can sing even higher notes. People often say she has a very strong voice, but she has not said this herself. \nShe did not learn singing in a special school but from being in a choir when she was in school. She can sing both low and high notes very well. She can also make her voice louder or softer when she sings. \nPeople who listen to her music often say that her singing is one of the best parts. They say her voice sounds like it's from another world, very strong and beautiful. \nShe often writes about having problems in relationships. She writes about events in her life as stories about her and a friend. For example, the song 'What You Want' is about her love for her music group and her fans. She also writes about her real-life problems, like in the song 'Call Me When You're Sober', which is about a man named Shaun. She often writes about dark and mysterious things, and she is very interested in the idea of what happens after we die. Sophia\\nSophia loves to sing songs about things that only exist in her dreams and songs that make you feel happy like the song \"In and Li\". The songs \"He and Li Y\" were sung for her sister who is no longer with us.\nAlso, Sophia's songs are usually about things that have happened in her life. She wrote a song called \"Br Me to Li\" after meeting a doctor who helped her understand her feelings, and she wrote a song called \"Sn Wh Qu\" after a scary time with a person who wouldn't leave her alone. She talks about how she writes her songs in the song \"Al Th I'm Li Fo\", and she says she likes to write when it's night time.\nAfter a man named Matthew left her band, Sophia told everyone that they were wrong to think her band's music would be softer and that all the \"sad stuff comes from [her]\". She said that Matthew liked to make music that everyone would like and that she wanted to do something more creative and different.\nSophia wrote a lot of songs on the band's album with her fans in mind. She wanted to share her feelings about them through her songs. She also sang about big problems like bad people who hurt others and a big earthquake and wave that happened far away in the songs \"My He is Br\" and \"Ne Go Ba\", respectively.\nSophia was given an award by the NA Mu Pu As for being a great songwriter in 2008. This award is given to songwriters who do really well. Sophia got the award during a big meeting in NE city and she sang a song for everyone there.\nSophia likes to wear different kinds of clothes. She likes clothes from the old times, clothes that look a bit spooky, and clothes from JA country. She likes to make a lot of her outfits herself, like the clothes she wore in the video of \"Go Un\" and the dress she wore to a big peace concert in 2011. Sophia\\nSometimes, Sophia makes her own clothes. Sophia once shared that she likes to make her own clothes because it's hard to find what she really wants in stores. Sophia said that she dresses differently on normal days and when she sings on stage. She described her everyday look as \"funny, spooky, cute\". She also explained that her clothes on stage help to tell the story of her songs. In the beginning, she wore a lot of tight dresses because she was worried about how her group would look. But now, she's more comfortable with her own style. Now, when she sings on stage, she usually wears boots, a simple black top, a skirt, and some pretty things.\nAlso, Sophia has black hair. In the past, she used to wear blue eye contacts and had a piercing on her left eyebrow. But she doesn't do that anymore.\nSophia is well-liked because she doesn't try to look attractive in her music. She doesn't like it when some women in music use their looks too much. She wrote a song called \"Everybody's Fool\" to make fun of these people. The music video for the song shows that some famous people are not always who they seem.\nIn 2005, Sophia was ranked 4th in a music magazine.Alice\\nAlice was named as one of the 50 most beautiful people in music. In 2006, Alice was named as one of the most beautiful women in music, along with other singers like Jessica and Lily. A magazine named Alice as the #1 most beautiful girl in hard music in their 2011 issue and she was on the front page. When asked about this, Alice said \"You have to see all of that as just talk. I'm not the most beautiful girl in whatever. I'm a normal girl and it takes a lot of makeup to make that page look good\". She also was named #9 in a 2011 list of \"The Twenty Most Beautiful Singers of Female-Led Music Bands\".\nAlice is married to a man named Jack who helps people feel better. They decided to get married on a winter day in 2007, with Alice telling everyone the day after. They got married in the spring of 2007 and on the bands' fan club message boards, she said that she was \"officially Mrs. Alice\". Jack inspired some of Alice's songs.\nAlice was in love with a singer named Samuel from 2003 till 2005. Their breakup led Alice to write a song which she said was about a big relationship she was in, and the whole breakup, which was really long. Samuel responded to the song, saying he was really upset that she would say and do those things but didn't feel the need to write back and be mean.\nWhen she was little, Lily wanted to be an animal doctor. But after seeing a dog getting surgery on TV, she didn't want to anymore. Lily said if she wasn't singing songs, she would want to help people, especially kids who have been hurt. When her band wasn't playing, Lily thought about becoming a music teacher for kids.\nLily likes to paint and cook. She drew the picture for the cover of \"TO book\" and painted the picture for a song to help others. She also said to her fans that she wanted to have a cooking show. Lily has two cats named Stella and Samuel.\nIn 2011, Lily said one of the reasons her band \"Ev band\" stopped playing for a while after their \"TO tour\" was because she was feeling tired from her band work. This was mostly because of the busy schedule and becoming famous very fast. Lily said she \"just needed to take a break\" and \"wanted to be a regular person for a bit\" because her \"grown-up life [...] was all about [Ev band]\".\nIn 2005, Lily started to help the \"EP group\" in the US, and started a project called \"Out of the Shadows\" to tell people more about a sickness called epilepsy. She cared about this because her brother has epilepsy.\nLily supports and helps a group called \"TW group\", which wants to help people who are very sad, who are addicted to bad things, and who hurt themselves. In 2010, she helped Restore Freedom, a project against bad people. She worked to build a safe place in NE city for people who had been hurt by bad people. She has a page on the Restore NE website where she asks people to give help. Lily later shared that helping this cause made her want to write the song \"My Heart is Broken\".\n\nLily was chosen in 2012 to get the Luella Bennack award at a big lunch for United Cerebral Palsy. This lunch celebrates women who spend time helping their communities. According to the UCP of NE city, Lily was chosen because she promised to make life better for everyone and for her music that \"made many women feel strong around the world\".\n\nIn 2000, Lily was part of two songs by her friend David. In 2003, Lily made music with artists like Milla and Maynard in a group called The Damning Well. She sang on two tracks, one was a song with Richard, but her singing was taken off the final song because of problems with the music company. She also sang on a song called \"Believe\" by Big Dismal.\n\nIn 2004, Lily sang in the song \"Broken\" with Shaun. The song was in a music set by Samuel in 2004, and also in a movie called The Punisher. The song Broken was shared with everyone and Lily was in the music video with black wings.\nIn February 2007, during a music show on TV featuring the band Kevin, Lily sang a song with the singer Jonathan Davis. The song was called Freak on a Leash. The TV channel later shared the song as part of the TV show featuring Kevin, and it became the first song shared from the music set.\nDuring Finger Eleven's opening act for a concert in PR city in 2007, Lily came on stage to sing the song \"One Thing\" with the band. Also, Lily sang the song \"Epiphany\" with Staind's lead singer Aaron Lewis during a festival in JO city, SA country in 2007.\nWhen asked who she wanted to work with, Lily chose DE band, Danny Elfman and DA band. She talked about a project in which Elfman would make music like in movies, while Lily would write the words and singing parts.\nLily talked about making her own music set since 2008. Lily told a magazine that she wanted to show she can do more than one thing and wanted to do something different. She also said that the music she was writing at that time was not like Evanescence.\nAfter writing a lot of the songs for Evanescences third music set, Lily decided to start over with the writing because the songs were not right for Evanescence and the other band members were not involved much. However, in a chat with PR radio, Lily talked about the chance of using the songs they didn't use in future work. She said it's possible that some of those songs will show up in a different work someday - maybe by herself, maybe something else.\nLily went to the CN TV in 2004, where she \"talked to a puppet\" and sang a \"funny song on the guitar about CN TV\". She did this for her little brother, Ryan, who was 10 years old then.\nShe was seen for a short time in the music video for Jake's song \"God's Going to Teach You a Lesson\" in late 2006. Everyone famous in the video got to pick what they wanted to do, so Lily picked to lay flowers on a grave. Her part was filmed at a church and she wore a black coat that once belonged to Tom. In the late 20th century, Lily was one of the famous people in the funny VH1 show \"Rock Group Arrives: The Rock Group Group Story\" that was made to talk about the RB game.\nLily was in an episode of \"Legends & Lyrics\" with artists Gary and David, where she played a few songs with her guitar, including \"Wake Me Up\", \"Battery\" and a new song called \"Your Love\", and talked about how she likes to make music and write songs.", "hash": "cf28d351f6f47df3e5a87f8bc3803ad9acf594ad8506549c3e05dd0a257c00bf"}

He was born in LA city to his mom Grace and dad Adam.\nRyan's earlier songs were known by his last name. He has written songs for many other singers, including Jennifer, Usher, and many others. He started working with a big music company when he was 16. His first album came out in 2003, and his second one came out in 2003. The second one was very popular and a lot of people bought it.

Ryan's song \"Blurred Lines\" was very popular in 2013.\nIn March 2013, his song \"Blurred Lines\", with T.I. and Pharrell, was released. It was loved by many people all around the world and it became number one in many places like UK, US, AU country, CA country, NE country, IR city, SP country, GE city, NE country, and PO city. Some people did not like the song and its video because they thought it was not nice to women. Some schools even stopped playing the song because of this. \"The song talks about girls in a bad way and makes it seem okay to not ask for permission, Hannah, a leader at a school, told news people. It is a boy saying that it's not clear when you need to ask for permission and that's not okay. We felt we needed to say something. Many funny versions of the video were made and shared online. Thomas, the singer, said the criticism was 'silly'. He said the song is about \"how boys and girls are a lot alike\" and \"how it's not always clear who is a good girl and who is a bad girl.\"\nOn a summer day, the album \"BL album\" was shared in the US. It was the top album on a music chart.\nIn August, the song was sung at a big music show with Madison. The show was talked about a lot online.

{"idx": 16417, "text": "Trouble of Taylor\nTaylor (born on a February day, passed away on an October day), was a 26-year-old girl from HE town, AL country. She passed away during her honeymoon at the big water park in QU country in 2003. She had been married to her husband, David, for only 11 days when this sad thing happened. The doctor said she had a water accident.\n\nSix years later, David was said to have done something very wrong. He said he was sorry for the accident and the court in QU country told him to stay in a place for a year where he can think about what he did. Six more months were added to his time after a meeting that took place just six weeks later. The meeting happened so soon because of concerns raised by Taylor's dad about the first meeting. But, the judges in the second meeting agreed with the first meeting on most things except the six month increase in the time.\n\nTaylor believed in God and had finished school at the big school in BI city, AL country. She worked as a team leader at a small store called Parisian. She was laid to rest at the HE Cemetery, in PE town, AL country, US country.\n\nWhile swimming at the site of the SS Ship, a passenger ship that sank a long time ago in the main shipping channel to the AU port of TO city, Taylor had trouble and then sank to the bottom of the sea. Taylor's accident in the water wasn't something bad people did in AU country. It was something a group of people looked into. Mr. William spoke to these people through his helpers. He came back to AU country by himself and spoke to people who were looking into what happened many times. Some of these talks can be found on the big web. At the time when people were deciding if he did something wrong, the people who were saying he did wrong said that Mr. William made a mistake because he didn't try to save his wife. They said that this mistake was just like doing something very bad (see: Big People's Choice). Taylor's dad said that, just before they got married, William had asked Taylor to make sure she had lots of money if something happened to her and that he would get all of it.\n\nAfter hearing that flowers and gifts left for Taylor at her special place were being ruined or were going missing, even when tied down with a chain, Mr. Frank looked into it. On a secret video, he saw William taking them away with big scissors and then throwing them away angrily. William then married a lady named Kim on a summer day in August.\n\nWilliam was tried for doing something very bad to his wife, Taylor, in a big building in BR city on a summer day in June. He said he didn't do the very bad thing to his wife. To the charge of accident, he said he was guilty. The judge said the charges made against him were not true and said he had to stay in a locked place for one year, with a further three and a half years waiting. This sentence resulted into Taylor's dad calling the AU justice system a \"joke\". He also said one of AU country's top helpers, Mr. Thomas, had not been telling the truth.\nThe reason Gabriel got one year in a place where you can't leave, was explained by the judge. He said that Gabriel had been blamed for things he didn't do, had felt very bad since Taylor's passing, and had listened to the Court. He said the news stories had not been fair. The judge said Gabriel came back to AU country because he wanted to in May of 2009 and gave himself up. The judge said Gabriel loved his wife, was very sorry for her passing and felt bad because he couldn't save her. He said that Gabriel did not cause the accident, but couldn't save Taylor when she had trouble breathing under water.\nThree judges listened to a request for a change made by the place called QU on a summer day in July, 2009. The place wanted Gabriel to stay in the place where you can't leave for two and a half years. Gabriel's helpers in AU country said the extra time was not fair because of what had happened before in this story. The judges told everyone their decision on a fall day in September, 2009.\nTo understand what happened after the request for a change, we need to know a little about how people who help in court think. On one side we have the place called QU, in AU country. In AU country, like in EN country and places like CA country and NE country, the place is usually called the \"Crown\" when people talk in court. In the US, the place is usually called \"The People\" or simply the \"Place\". The request for a change was listened to by three judges of the QU Court of Change, which is the top court in the place.\nThe King had said that Gabriel's time out should be longer because it thought the time out was wrong. Gabriel's helpers replied this was not so. They said that Gabriel had never done anything wrong before and he was a good boy. Tina's going away happened by mistake, and the short time out was fair according to his helpers.\nThe big Court helpers also said that the bad claim was not true. The big helpers agreed about most of the trial. But they didn't agree about the time out. On one side, Mr. Matthew said the big Court shouldn't change what the trial helper said. On the other side, Chief Mr. David said time out should be longer to two and a half years. In the third idea, Mr. Cameron said it should be longer from twelve months to eighteen months. To agree, the Chief went with Cameron's idea.\nWith the agreement of two of the three big helpers, the time out was made longer to eighteen months. Each big helper carefully told their thoughts. Finally, Cameron said of Gabriel, \"That he himself quickly told what proved the case against him and that for years he has carried the unfair blame, told to everyone, of doing something really bad are things that need his time out to be shorter.\" (Gabriel told the information which showed he had made a big mistake. Because he was for many years unfairly blamed and unfairly said to have done something really bad, his time out should be shorter.)\nFor some years, no one paid much attention to what happened, since people sometimes get hurt in the water in AU country. Taylor's mom and dad however, tried to tell everyone about what happened and by 2007 they did. There were other people swimming near Greg and Taylor when Taylor got hurt. One swimmer took a picture of Taylor, lying on the bottom of the water, while taking a picture of another swimmer having fun. This picture was not seen until a few weeks later when the pictures were looked at. The people trying to find out what happened were not sure if Taylor was already hurt in the picture or if she was just not awake. The picture does not tell us why Taylor sunk to the bottom.\nAfter being told by Taylor's family that flowers and gifts were being broken or going missing from the place where she was buried, even when chained down, Officer Frank looked into it. On hidden videos, he saw Greg taking them away with big cutters and putting them into the trash, which Frank then showed to everyone.\nTaylor's dad told everyone in November 2009, two months after the decision, that he thinks Greg did something very bad. He might have got the idea from another bad thing that almost happened in the BR islands.\nWhat happened to Taylor was shown in a 90-minute show that was shown on a famous show on Monday, May 19, 2008. What happened to Taylor made a lot of people talk about it in both AU and AM countries and also from people all around the world because it was so strange.\nHowever, people, especially from the AU country, have often talked about what happened to Taylor as if someone had done it on purpose, while the people in charge in AU country found that it was an accident because someone didn't help. This problem came up in the \"TO newspaper\" on 10 February 2010. They said again that Tina's death was \"very bad\". A week later they said they were sorry and fixed what they said:\nOn a summer day in 2010 a big AU country newspaper, \"TH newspaper\", wrote a full story on the Watson case called \"Sad thing at the coral place\". The writer was a man named Peter who won a prize for finding out things. This is the first time the news had talks from both Gabe's family and Tina's family. Using experts, the story says that Gabe was not found guilty of the very bad thing by the QU Court of Appeal but was found guilty of not doing something he should have done by a part of the QU rules that not many people knew about. This is against rule 290. Peter says the court decided to call this something less bad. The story says Gabe did something wrong by not helping his wife when she was in trouble. It also talks about Tina's heart problems and the medicine she was taking, in the morning she died, including pills so she wouldn't feel sick at sea. Peter says that Tina said 'no' to a health question at her dive training, which asked about past heart problems. He also says that because Mr. Watson had not been diving for some time, his skill to help would have been like a beginner.\nThe story ended up being important all over the world, because in a small note, Peter said he had written to AU's big boss, Robert, asking Watson not to be sent to AL, because he could get a very bad punishment in that place and because he had already been tried in the AU state of QU, with a careful look by the QU Court of Appeal. This made a police website in AL state ask questions about the reporter and Mr. William.\nOn a cold winter day in 2010, William stood in front of Judge Thomas in the big court of the 10th area, in Jefferson County, AL state asking to be let out.\nThere were many people in the court. His friends and family, reporters from AU and US country, and some people from Taylor's family.\nDon, AL's helper attorney general, told the judge that William was accused because Tommy said that William had hurt Taylor to get insurance money.\nAfter a loud argument, Judge Thomas said that a reason is not the same as proof. He asked what clear proof the State had against William. Don answered that the question of the reason was for the jury to decide.\nAfter a one-hour talk, William was let out but with a promise of $100,000. He had to wear a special bracelet, give up his passport, not leave AL state, and stay inside his house when the sun goes down until it comes up.\nWhen the people in the court heard that William was going to be let out, they stood up and cheered. This made Judge Thomas say, \"Sit down, sit down; this is not a game for people to watch.\"\nOn the last day of January in 2011, William stood in Judge Thomas' court to answer two things: first, that he had taken Taylor to AU country with the idea of hurting her, and second, that he had hurt her while they were swimming under the sea at the Great Barrier Reef.\nHe said \"Not Guilty\" to both things.\nThe date they decided to talk about the problem was a day in May (but it was moved to a day in February next year because they were worried about safety). Mr. Victor told Judge Tommy that important people were going to come from AU country. He then said that a man named David, who was a big boss in AU country and responsible for Gabriel's big trouble, would not come. They didn't say why they changed their minds about David. They talked about this for just a little while.\nOn a winter day in February, the problem with David Gabriel \"Gabriel\" Watson was solved by Judge Tommy in a court in BI city, AL country. The Judge didn't believe what the state was saying and said, \"This doesn't make sense.\"\nWhen he finished, the Judge decided, \"There is no proof that he [Gabriel] wanted to hurt her and planned it here and did it there. I'm going to say yes to this man's request. Problem solved.\"\nWatson was never going to get the worst punishment because both the US and AL country said to the AU country government, he would not get the worst punishment. He would have had to stay in prison forever, if they said he did it.\nOn a summer day in August, the TV channel called LM showed a TV movie called, \"Scary Holiday\".\nThe TV channel said the movie was about a true story where Gabriel Watson took his new wife, Tina Watson, and hurt her during their swimming trip to AU country a long time ago. It's about Benjamin who played the role of Gabe and Alice who played the role of Tina, with Henry playing the role of the father of a lady who was no longer living. Gary, another known actor, played the role of a strong AU country police officer named Detective Cameron.\nThe story is based on a book named \"Holiday Dive\" written by Liam and Jessica. The book tries to understand what really happened to Tina, but many things have happened since the book was written.\n\"Scary Holiday\" was directed by Nora. The people who wrote the story were Matthew and Taylor.\nGeorge, who writes reviews for TV shows says the story doesn't feel real, and the people in it don't feel like real people who had something very sad happen to them.\nJessica, who writes reviews on a website called \"Crushable\", says \"Scary Holiday\" is a show that makes men look very bad and women look like they didn't know what was happening.", "hash": "82309f1ebec38d54490e609e32a1ba36b90274deee83ac25527d124ab4d83c14"}

{"idx": 53811, "text": "Big Secrets\nBig Secrets is a term that was first used by a secret group during the time when a man named Kevin was in charge. It meant that some important people in the government were not told about some things that the secret group was doing that were not allowed. If someone found out about these things, these people could say that they didn't know anything about it and maybe they would be telling the truth. It meant that the things the secret group did could not be blamed on the leader of US country.\nThe idea has to do with leaving a \"trail of clues\", where people who write news find proof of talks between important people and those who did the not allowed things. If someone listens to phone calls or reads messages that are not for them, they might also find proof of bad things done by important people. If there is no clear proof of a bad thing done by an important person, then we can believe them when they say they didn't do it. The denial \"might\" be true, which is one of the main things that public people want: to not be caught doing something not allowed. If an official is caught, it can be a big problem: see Watergate scandal.\n\"Playing safe\" is when someone in charge doesn't want to take the blame for something. They might give unclear orders, like Henry saying \"Who will help me with this noisy man?\" or even less clear \"Someone should help with that\". Everyone understands what he means. But later, when the thing is done, the boss can say \"I didn't mean that\".\n\nPlaying safe works when no one writes down what was said. Then, no one can find out who did what. If people start talking about it, the big bosses can say they didn't know anything about it or anyone involved. It usually means the bosses thought about it before and made sure they wouldn't get in trouble later.", "hash": "0b7bccffeadcdd734c2ee73939c08d1982f1b4cb3e9b97a5ab5aa8835f6d4ae1"}

{"idx": 6751, "text": "Adam\nAdam (born in VE city, early in March a long time ago; passed away in VI city, during the summer of a later year) was a man from IT country who made a lot of music. He was the most important music maker in IT country at a time long ago.\nAdam wrote more than 400 pieces of music for different instruments, especially for the violin. The music for 21 of his plays, including his first and last, are still here. His most loved work is a set of four violin pieces called The Four Sounds. Each piece talks about a season: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. He is thought to be the person who made a new way of writing music. He was very famous for his small flute music, such as \"The Little Bird\".\nAdam likely learned to play the violin from his father, who was a music maker. He learned to be a church helper, and because of his red hair, he got the nickname, \"the red church helper.\". He didn't work as a church helper for very long, and a long time ago, he started teaching violin to girls at a home for kids without parents in VE city, called the Kind Home of Mercy. The girls were chosen because they were really good at making music. They did music shows often, so part of Adam's job was to write music for them to play. He lost the job for a short time, but then he got it back. He also did another job of making beautiful music for the girls' choir. He kept teaching until he was asked to manage all the music happenings in 1716.\nVictor's music was getting famous. When he was not teaching between 1709 and 1711, he made a lot of music pieces including ones for the violin. In 1711, he made a set of 12 music pieces, \"a famous music set\", for one, two and four solo violins was made available by a man in AM city. This made him known all over Europe, and people who made music who came to VE city would visit Victor for lessons. More new music pieces of his made him even more famous. The first of his many stories told through music, \"a famous story\", was performed in 1713. His first big story told through music, \"another famous story\", was performed by the girls from the PI in 1716.\nIn 1718 Victor left VE city and moved to MA city, where he was in charge of music for the city leader, Prince Patrick. He made his famous \"Four Seasons\" and some more stories told through music during this time. He went to RO city in about 1721, where he played his music for the Pope. While he was travelling, he kept making music for the girls at PI, over the years he sent them about 140 music pieces. He visited many cities in Europe to show his stories told through music including VI city, VE city, and PR city. He often went back to VE city to practice his songs with the girls.\nEven though his songs were loved, Victor didn't earn much from his songs. When new musicians and newer styles became the trend, he found it harder to get money. He moved to AU country to play for the king but when the king passed away, he had no money and couldn't go back home. He passed away without much money, in VI city, during a summer month.", "hash": "a591a89479b22e8ecfad63f64fd2142869da288ec76af3f39073e5458ae09071"}

It has more than 90 million square feet of space.\nWilliam comes from a very old family. His family has been in BA city for a long time. His great-great-great-grandfather James was a man who sent things by ship in the 18th and 19th century. He was also a big boss at the bank, a helper in the city, and was related to a man named Jack. His grandmother, Anne, started a school for boys in RO city in 1897.\nAs a young man, Cameron left his school to go to another school in CT state, then went to PU university and UP university.

Frank didn't have money for school, so he did many small jobs like selling ice-cream, being a guard at a night place, and making bread at night. He also taught himself by going to the local book place in LE town. Frank liked the work of Frederick, Ludwig, Leonard, and Oscar, and he finished school in MA city in 1961.\nFrank won a special award to go to the YE school for building design, where he met his future friend Richard. Richard and he learned a lot there. Their teacher, Victor, told them to go on a trip to AM country for a year. After they came back to UK country in the middle of the 20th century, they started a group called Team 4 with Richard and two sisters, Grace and Wendy. Grace was the only one in the team who had finished her big exams, which let them start their own building design group. Team 4 quickly became known for their smart designs.\n\nAfter Team 4 decided to go their separate ways, Frank and Wendy started another group called Foster Friends, which later became Frank and Friends in the late 20th century. A long time of working together with an AM country builder, Richard, started in the late 20th century and continued until Richard left us. They worked together on many projects that helped people think about how to build things in a way that's good for our world - including the project for a drama place named Samuel.\n\nAt first, they focused on buildings for making things. The big change came when they made a special building for a company called Fred. in LO city, where people who work and their bosses weren't separated anymore. Frank and Friends' big success in the UK country was a building for a family insurance company in IP city, in the middle of the 20th century. The family wanted to make their workers feel like a community. Frank made big open spaces for work long before it was popular. In a town that didn't have many public places, the gardens on the roof, the big swimming pool and the place for exercise made the workers' lives better. The building has a full wall of glass that follows the old street plan and makes the place look exciting, changing from dark, reflecting black to a bright, see-through color when the sun sets. David\\nDavid was inspired by a big building in MA city that he really liked when he was young. The building is now very special and protected.\\nThe SA Centre for Pictures and Things, a place to see art and learn about it at the UN School in NO city, was one of the first big public buildings that David made. It was finished in the late 20th century and became very special and protected at the end of the year in 2012. In the late 20th century, David made a design for the big building at the LO Airport and it won a big award.\\nDavid became well-known for making buildings for work. In the past, he made a building for HS Company in HO city. Everyone in the building can see the light very well, as all the people working there can see the VP hill or VH harbor. David said that if he hadn't gotten this job, he would probably have no money left. David thinks that having young people who are very talented is very important, and he's happy that the average age of people working for him is 32, just like it was long ago.\\nNowadays, David and his team work with their engineers to use computers. They think about simple rules like how warm air goes up. They have made buildings that work really well like the SR Company office in LO city. The walls let in cool air and then let it out as it gets warm and rises.\\nDavid's earlier designs were sleek and looked like they were made by machines. His style has changed into something more modern and sharp-edged. In 2004, Frank made the tallest bridge in the world, the MI bridge in the FR country. The mayor of MI, Jack, said; \"The builder, Frank, made us a beautiful thing.\"\nIn the first month of 2007, a big news paper said that Frank had asked a company to find people who wanted to buy Frank + Friends. Frank doesn't want to stop working, but wants to sell most of his part in the company which is worth a lot of money.\nFrank is a helper for a group that helps to make safe and good buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also helped another group that makes buildings.\nThe reason Frank has a lot of money is because he gets some money when a building is made.\nIn 2007, he worked with Peter and Richard of the V Group for the V Sky plans.\nFrank made the home for a big company called Apple and is now making most of their shops. He is also making a big building in LO city. He also recently made a YC club and a MT place.\nFrank helps a group that makes safe and good buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also helped another group that makes buildings.\nHe has recently made the Frank Foundation which helps people to think and study to help new builders, designers and city planners to think about the future.", "hash": "3fd8278aadf122a8d609cb659cfd9293fdda25cfffd3595d3855979985cb6021"}

In most healthy coral homes, hard corals are mostly seen. They are made by many tiny creatures that build a hard shell around them. These coral homes are made in warm sea areas around the middle of our Earth. The coral home is where many colorful fish and other sea animals live. People like to look at coral homes because they are very pretty and colorful. They see them when they swim under the water with special gear.\nPeople can see a coral home in MA country at TI island, and also one of the most famous - the GR coral home.\nMost coral homes we see today were made after the last big cold time when the ice melted and made the sea level go up. This means they are less than 10,000 years old. When the water went up, the coral homes kept growing up too. If they did not grow up, they got covered by too much water and there was not enough light for them to live.\nWe can also find coral homes in the deep sea, far from the land, around islands and in circles. The Big Ocean Islands\\nMost of the big ocean islands are made from lava from volcanoes. Only a few are made because of the ground moving and pushing up the bottom of the ocean.\\nCoral reefs are very delicate. Because corals need warm, sunny water to live, they often grow close to the top of the water. Being so close to land makes them often get hurt by bad stuff and dirt that can come from boats and the land nearby. Dirt makes the water more cloudy, which makes less sunlight. Bad stuff can hurt and kill corals. Also, they are hard for ships to see, but easy to hit, which makes ships often bump into the coral, hurting both the boats and coral. Because of this, many places are trying to stop the kinds of building that usually happen near beaches that have coral reefs nearby, and be more careful about the boats that go around reefs.", "hash": "ddd8c626608a6c8252bd5432bd91b0934e97e9b67b03771fef5d6c130bb77e09"}

{"idx": 141039, "text": "NE Group\\nThe NE Group is a group of people who help to make rules in IN country. It's made up of people who think similar things, and it's led by the BR Party. It was started a long time ago.\\nIts first leader was a man named Adam. Then, a man named Liam took over as the leader and was the leader for 10 years. Then, a man named Adam has been the leader for a while now. The group was in charge from a long time ago until a little bit later. They came back in charge after an important vote with a lot of people saying they wanted them. Their leader, Nathan, became the main person in charge of IN country on a day in May. In the next big vote, they got even more people to say they wanted them.\\nThe NE Group was started a long time ago to go against another group called the CO Group. It was led by the BR Party, and had a lot of people from different places, like the SA Party and the AI Group. There was also another group that thought the same things as the BR Party. After the vote, they were just able to be in charge with help from another group, which let Adam be the main person in charge again.\nThe big group of leaders didn't last a year because the AI group stopped helping. After more local groups joined, the ND group won the next time with more support. Victor became the main leader for a third time, and this time he stayed for a full five years.\nThe ND group wanted to have a vote early in 2004, ahead of time. They said \"IN country is doing great\" to show how good they were. They said they made the country better. But, the ND group did not win. They only got 186 votes, but the UP group led by the CO group, with Matthew, got 222 votes. Matthew took over Victor's job as the main leader. Some people say the ND group lost because they didn't talk enough to the people who live in the countryside.\nThe ND group doesn't have a main group of leaders like a board. It was up to the leaders of each group to decide things like who gets to be in the elections, who gets to be in charge of different jobs, and what issues are talked about. Because the groups have different ideas, there have been many times when they disagreed and voted differently.\nBecause of bad health, Gabriel, who was the ND group's main helper until 2008, had to stop his job. He was replaced by Samuel, the then leader of the JD party. On a summer day in June, the JD left the group and Samuel stepped down from his role. Then the leader of AN place, Cameron, took over. \nOn a summer day in July, JD formed the government in BI place with the help of another group. Later, on a summer day in August, JD formally rejoined the group after 4 years. \nAs of a spring month in 2020, the other group controls many places like AR place, AS place, GO place, GU place, HI place, KA place, MA place, MA island, TR place, UP place and UT place. In HA place, the group shares power as the main partner (the leader is from the group) with another party.", "hash": "491ede7edda7eecf17c59de848cd02668292ea438a1aac2ce4b41cfdae2f849d"}

{"idx": 140808, "text": "Matthew\\nMatthew (born on a Spring day in May, went away on a Winter day in February) was a man from FR country who studied people and groups. He was also the nephew of another famous man, Ethan. Matthew is known for his work on presents and trading, magic, giving up things, the body, and comparing different places. Matthew's most famous work is \"The Present\". \"The Present\" is about the ways presents and trading build friendships. Matthew is also known for influencing other people who study people such as Cameron.\nMatthew\\nMatthew was born in PI town, FR country in a year long ago. His parents were Gabriel and Rachel. He was raised in a family that didn't follow Jewish traditions very closely.\nIn his early years, Matthew went to the BO university where he learned about many things including stories about gods and big ideas. Later he moved to PA city, FR country where he studied at a very important school. In PA city, Matthew studied old languages, history of gods' stories, and other things. Matthew eventually became a teacher at the important school. He taught about many different stories of gods.\nDuring a big war, Matthew worked in the FR country army as a helper who knew many languages.\nMatthew helped make the study of people's ways (Ethnology) at the PA university in 1925 with two other people. He also was the head of the group about understanding people's actions at the PA university for a few years.\nMatthew's ideas about the role of presents in MA culture relied heavily on the information provided by Thomas. Thomas was a MA scholar who exchanged letters with Ethan. Through these letters, Thomas explained how presents were used to connect people in MA society. According to Thomas, presents made people feel like they owed something without being forced. These feelings created by presents made friendships and bonds stronger.\nEthan was a man who loved to learn about different people and their ways of life. He studied the MI people of NE island. Matthew used the letters and information from Ethan to write about how the MI people liked to give gifts.\nmile David was Matthew's uncle and also taught him a lot. They worked together on many things. David and Matthew worked together to write a book called \"How People Sort Things\". This book answered some questions about how we understand things. David and Matthew also wrote articles for a book about people and how they live together.\n\"A Book About Gifts\" was written in the early 20th century. It was written after a big change in RU country. In this book, Matthew said that every group of people has a way to trade and some kind of money, as well as kindness. Matthew said that gifts are very important and can have special meanings. \"A Book About Gifts\" also talks about how some very old groups of people give gifts. Matthew writes about the MI idea of \"Hau\". He also talks about a special party called Potlatch, which was first done by old groups of people in NO country. Matthew believed that giving gifts can tell us a lot about how people get along. He also believed that giving gifts was connected to who is in charge. Matthew said that there is no such thing as a gift that doesn't need to be returned. He thought every gift was part of a system of giving and getting.\nMatthew also thought of giving up something as a type of trade. In a time long ago, Matthew and Henry wrote a book about saying thank you and being kind. This book looks at many ways people show respect and kindness, focusing on gifts and sharing. Matthew and Henry looked at many different places and times. They talked about gifts as a way of showing both love and respect for others and also showing that you don't want to make others feel bad. They said that our actions and behavior make us who we are.\nMatthew and Henry worked together again to write another book called \"A Big Idea about Magic\". In this book, they said that not just people, but also events can be magic. This is like their earlier work on gifts. They said that magic is a shared experience. The book looks at how magic, religion, and science and tools are all connected. Matthew and Henry also talked about how the idea of magic has affected our modern ideas, like the idea of good and bad luck.\nMany years later, in 2017, Grace wrote a book where she disagreed with Matthew's ideas about Hau, a way of sharing. Grace said that because of different languages and ideas about the world, Matthew didn't really understand the concept of Hau. Adam (in 1998) also disagreed with Matthew, saying that Matthew was wrong about the idea that all gifts need to be paid back. Adam said there are truly free gifts, like when you give money to a person in need as you walk by them. Jack\\nJack talks about how in a certain belief, people give gifts freely.\\nJack is known for inspiring Cameron. Cameron developed a way of understanding people's customs and traditions. Jack also inspired other people like Patrick. Jack is famous for helping people understand things like trading and how people deal with money. Jack was one of the first people to compare different cultures, and this helped other people study cultures in the same way.", "hash": "5bbefd88a274122b6cc9e9e54b61e6293c839ef2bf42e3756939202f36f3cef8"}

He built a house near a river in 1647. Later, some families from SA city came here because they were scared of witches. They lived in a part of the town that we still call SA's End.\nThis place was first called DA's Farm, after Thomas. Thomas's family came to MA state from a place called FR town in EN country. The first time people asked for this place to become a town was in 1693, but they were told no because Thomas didn't want it to become a town. After Thomas was gone, people made this place a town in 1700.\nIn 1706, the first school was built. The first teacher was a man named Joshua.\nOn a winter day in 1775, a man from BR country sent people to spy on the town.
